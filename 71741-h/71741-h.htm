<p>It is important in military matters that a writer shall
express definitely the ideas he intends to convey and in
such phraseology that there can be no misunderstanding
of the language used. Carelessly or improperly phrased
instructions have caused many miscarriages of military
plans. The attainment of perfection in the use of language
is a matter of painstaking study and the gradual
refinement of practice. Merely dreaming of what one will
do when responsibility is thrust upon him is not the way
to prepare for successful achievement. It is the duty of
every self respecting officer to be ready to do not only his
best but to do what is right.</p>

<p>When one has qualified himself to write or dictate orders
and instructions properly he has already learned to interpret
those he may receive from others. Accuracy of language
demands discipline of mind. Under our system of
raising war armies much has had to be entrusted to men
without either discipline of mind or of character. This
makes it necessary for officers not only to be qualified
themselves to prepare and to interpret orders, but to teach
the art to others.</p>

<p>Carelessly written instructions are like contoured maps
with the base data omitted, leaving one in doubt as to
whether he is observing a hill or a depression. A recent
instance of such carelessness, coming under my observation,
may serve to illustrate this: orders were received at
my headquarters to call out certain reservists for actual
service and direct them to report at Fort Wayne, Indiana.
In the execution of the order individual telegrams were
dispatched during the night. As orders had been received
previously to turn over for the training of such reservists
several permanent posts, including Fort Wayne, near Detroit,
Michigan, telegraphic inquiry was made to find out
if a mistake had been made. The reply established that
the Post of Fort Wayne, Michigan, and not the City of
Fort Wayne, Indiana, was intended.</p>

<p>Modern warfare of nations-in-arms is vastly different
from the campaigns and open field fighting of the smaller
armies of past wars. Nations no longer entrust the preparation
and solution of their military problems to old type
of practical soldiers. Military Academies, War Colleges,
and General Staff Colleges have become necessary to insure
that only trained men shall be entrusted with the
preparation of instructions for the employment of the
forces.</p>

<p>To combine the study of tactical problems, the preparation
of orders and the correct use of language, as contemplated
by Major Ganoe, will afford a great advantage
to the student of today, and should make the diaries,
journals, and war histories of the future finished writings
without necessity for editing. These are the true sources
of military history, a knowledge of which is essential to
the ambitious officer desirous of perfecting himself in his
profession.</p>

<p>This course of lessons has for its sole object a demonstration
to the military man that rhetoric is a big part of
his profession. If he sees this advantage early it is hoped
that he will not slight his rich language as so many of us
have done to our later regret. Vocational training in
English! That is practically what this book is. It is
recognizing rhetoric for the first time as a separate study
in the field service regulations. Just as we take up topography,
engineering, sanitation, and supply as sciences by
themselves in order to fit our efficiency into the team work
of battle later, so here we apply ourselves to that part of
field work which helps us state our ideas in a proper military
manner.</p>

<p>The course is in no way tactics, but it forms an excellent
primer to tactics. It leads up to and aids in the solution
of tactical problems by passing over military ground.
Because it is a combination of analysis and synthesis,
rhetoric, as we know, is, unlike the exact sciences, purely
a secondary subject. Its material, whether of poetry,
essay, or fiction, is indiscriminate in its selection of matter
so long as the matter is good. The idea in this book is
to make both the material and the treatment count—to
place the emphasis upon the manner of expressing oneself
and to let the student see incidentally the interesting
military features as he is passing along. He will be
learning what he has never before had the opportunity of
taking up separately, and what will lead him more easily
into intricate tactical paths afterwards.</p>

<p>Some will criticise the book in that the author is not
conforming to the principles which he is enunciating. They
will say, “He tells us to boil our communications to the
clearest minimum while he himself deals in reiteration and
illumination.” Although this objection appears just, it
is nevertheless cursory. A closer view will reveal the fact
that the <em>purpose</em> and <em>readers</em> of communications are quite
different from the <em>purpose</em> and <em>readers</em> of a text book.
One of the first principles we learn in rhetoric is to suit
our treatment and diction to our <em>purpose</em> and <em>readers</em>.
Commanders await with interest and expectancy the words
of a field message or order. Students await with skepticism
or inertia the chapters of their lessons. Although
we rightly can prescribe the severest clearness for something
which is bound to be absorbed, we cannot be satisfied
with one precise, colorless statement of that which
is likely to be ignored. The student must be cudgeled and
enticed. As a proof of the correctness of this position,
this course has been tried with unexpected success upon
the Cadets of the United States Military Academy. The
very items which have been repeated and highly colored
have proven themselves to the instructors to be the very
ones which have more easily driven the points home.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is made by the author to
Lieut. Colonel L. H. Holt, Professor of English and History,
who made the book possible; to Captain G. Hoisington,
Infantry, for drawing a plate; to Captains J. R.
N. Weaver, Infantry, R. H. Lee, Coast Artillery Corps,
L. E. Moreton, Coast Artillery Corps, C. C. Benson,
Cavalry, and J. H. Grant, 24th Infantry, for their valuable
criticism; and to Major A. W. Chilton, Infantry, for
the revision of the book in order to make it conform to the
practical work passed over—by his disinterested correction
the whole becomes more valuable as a text.</p>

<p>All military language should be of the utmost brevity
and clarity. Death and disaster are the direct results
of ambiguity. Throughout all history mistaken directions
and information have been the ruin of whole campaigns.
Careless wording, like careless shooting, is not only ineffective
but often suicidal.</p>

<p>The object of these few lessons is to give practice in
putting the language of military communication into form.
It is hoped that by means of certain technical and rhetorical
principles the student may gain proficiency in expressing
his thoughts as he intends them and as military efficiency
demands them.</p>

<p>Our Field Service Regulations state that “clear and
decisive orders are the logical result of definite and sure
decisions.” But this statement does <em>not</em> imply that if a
person arrives at a definite and sure decision, he gains
clear and decisive phraseology without effort on his part.
General Wagner, a pioneer among American military
authorities, divides into completely separate operations the
act of deciding upon a definite plan of action and that of
drafting or framing orders which will carry that decision
into effect. One is purely military and has to do with dispositions
of forces; the other is mainly rhetorical and has
to do with manipulations of language. Many a military
man has decided certainly in his own mind what he is going
to do in order to carry out his mission, only to be faced
immediately with a harder task. He must set that definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
idea in the mind of some one else. “How,” he sighs, “shall
I put this so as to let my Captains, Smith and Jones,
know exactly what I want?” He seats himself on a warm
rock under the blazing sun and chews his pencil. What
he at first writes down, he finds, is full of loop-holes and is
not expressive of what he means. He tries again, crosses
out words here and there, adds others, and changes his
sentences until the whole is undecipherable. In disgust he
tears up the paper and tries again. After fifteen minutes
of such effort he holds in his hand a few paragraphs of
which he is not proud, but which will have to do. There
has been no want, perhaps, of clear tactical reasoning on
his part, but rather a distinct lack of ability to drive
common English home. His case, we find, is not exceptional.
One has only to listen to the discussions of military
beginners (or of some, alas, who are not military
beginners) to hear this statement confirmed. How often
after having given careful or even brilliant estimates of
a situation will a man burst out with, “I know what I
mean right here, but don’t quite know how to say it!”
All the way along there has been a decided blank space
between decision in the mind and embodiment in language.</p>

<p>Whether slang, profanity, or colloquialisms have cut
into our ordinary speech to such an extent as to keep us at
a loss for the apt word, or whether we have grown careless
or slovenly in our habits of expression, is a matter with
which we are not concerned here. We do know that we
are continually hampered by our inability to state absolutely
our meaning. This lack of skill in composition which
besets us, we must overcome in our profession, for the sake
of the lives dependent upon our words. Napoleon sitting
at his desk scribbling off orders and messages as fast as
his nimble fingers can travel, his secretaries standing about
him grasping each finished piece from under his pen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
sending it off immediately by courier without revision
or correction, is a dazzling picture for the military leader
to contemplate. In his writing, a commander capable of
carrying out single-handed all the phases and minor items
of the mightiest of campaigns could, no doubt, be precise
and accurate habitually. He <em>was</em> a genius. Yet Napoleon
had had long years of practice in putting his will into
words; for, we are told, he began to compose orders and to
think tactically and strategically at a time of life when
most of us have not even chosen our careers. If, then,
we can try our hand at transcribing our ideas in as formative
a period as possible in our military careers, we, too,
may attain a proficiency that will become a second nature
with us. At least, we may put behind us a great part of
this uninteresting but indispensable work of learning to
control our language, before we confront the more serious
task of straightening out tactical and strategical difficulties
in the presence of the enemy.</p>

<p>Incidentally, while we are on our way in our progress in
expression, we may pick up much valuable military information.
In our practice with tactical language we must
make use of certain facts which have been found by experience
appropriate to certain happenings connected
with officers’ and soldiers’ duties. We shall be in constant
touch with the workings of patrols, advance guards, outposts,
and forces in battle. Like so many reporters we
shall be present at maneuvers putting our notes into
graphic and specific form.</p>

<p>Now, however, we are going to rivet our attention to
the main issue—the mastery of clear and brief military
communication. It has been mentioned that such ready
skill often prevents loss of battles and human life. It
prevents another loss which we have not taken up separately—the
loss of time. The officer who sat chewing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
pencil on the warm rock threw away from ten to twelve
minutes which might have been used profitably upon the
accomplishment of his mission—an amount of time which
might have given the very advantage needed to gain a complete
victory over the enemy. If he had had a skilful working
knowledge of his own Mother Tongue, the delay would
not have occurred. His effectiveness was lost for want of
power of expression. To illustrate further, consider for
a moment an army post going about its routine duties
of drill, guard, and police. Into the Adjutant’s office
walks an individual who announces himself to be Major
Smart of the Inspector General’s Department. On being
introduced to the Colonel, he identifies himself, and gives
immediate orders that the Colonel shall have his regiment
on the parade ground ready for field service in fifteen
minutes. When the troops are formed, the Inspector rides
up to the Colonel, hands him a typewritten tactical problem,
and asks for a solution of it as soon as possible. The
Inspector then takes out his watch and observes. If the
Colonel consumes more than a reasonable number of
minutes in writing his orders, or if he shows a hesitancy in
so doing, or if he must seek aid from his Adjutant, it is
surprising to note how soon after Major Smart’s departure
from the post, the Colonel receives a letter from
Washington apprising him of his shortcomings, and recommending,
for his own good, a speedy remedy. Because
of the inroads upon efficiency, the War Department, like
any good business firm, cannot brook vacillation or unwarranted
loss of time.</p>

<p>We must, then, adopt some method or procedure by
which we will effectually beat down the causes of this loss
of time, battles, and life. After analysing past proficiencies
and deficiencies in military communication, we spy
out from all the roads to the goal open to us, two which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
appear to be shorter than the rest. If we guide ourselves
along these we shall come upon our object in the quickest
way. Since the first leads into the second, they are given
here in order. We should strive: (1) To learn to find
quickly expressions which will cover information and decisions
that are trying to struggle into language; and (2)
To plant that information and decision into the recipient’s
understanding exactly as it was rooted in our minds.</p>

<p><em>The first process is that of defining thoughts exactly
and briefly.</em></p>

<p><em>The second process is that of making those thoughts so
unmistakable that the most stupid cannot misunderstand
and the most captious cannot misinterpret.</em></p>

<p>After we have done the first, we should look over our
work and be certain that we have done the second.</p>

<p>The first has to do with the kind of situation that faced
the man who knew what he “wanted to say but couldn’t
express himself.” Some authorities argue that there is no
difference between clear thinking and clear expression.
They give no place to the “mute inglorious Milton.” They
would not concede that the man groping for language
had formed a definite plan in his mind, because that
plan was not definite enough to be expressed. “If he has
not thought in language,” they say, “he has not really
thought.” Their opponents claim that a man thinks in
pictures, and that he conceives his ideas as a painter imagines
objects. In his mind are the outlines and colors of
what he considers. There is truth in both views of the
matter. But it is likely from what we know of the training
of the military man that his mind works more by visualizing
the troops and by conjuring up the scene than by gaining
his conceptions through words. His forces are moving
along roads, occupying trenches, or surging into conflict.
His map is not a plane surface with names upon it, but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
vision of highways, waving corps, and rolling hills. He is
looking at these things without mentally describing them.
For the purpose of this course, we shall take the view that
there are occasions where we deduce certain results, but are
unable, because of unfamiliarity with framing good sentences
or because of a small vocabulary, to communicate
those results or deductions in accordance with common
usage.</p>

<p>The second road can be illustrated by comparison with
the first. There is a wide difference, although at first there
does not appear to be, between merely stating a thing
clearly and making it unmistakable. The first is but a
negative approach to complete certainty of expression,
but the second must be a positive one. The distinction
is one more or less of attitude of mind, and although heretofore
it has been overlooked as an entity in English text
books and military regulations, it assuredly illustrates itself
in two types of men who actually exist. The man who
is content with merely making himself clear takes the attitude
of, “O, well, they will get what I meant because any
other interpretation is absurd or incorrect.” The man
who is not content unless he makes himself unmistakable
says, “I won’t let any of them have the slightest excuse
for any other interpretation; when I get through there
will be but <em>one</em> interpretation and that will be <em>mine</em>.” The
first one in sending a message to his commanding officer
locates himself by putting in his heading, “Irrigation
ditch 500 yards east of southeast corner of Catholic
Church.” He notices another irrigation ditch fifty yards
further to the east, but says to himself, “If my commanding
officer measures the distance on the map he will know
which one I mean.” The second man, upon looking about
him and discovering the other ditch, does not accept the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
chance of letting his commanding officer confuse the two
ditches by a possible difference of maps or measuring instruments.
He investigates further. By moving a few
yards to the top of a hillock he notices that the farther
ditch is entirely a dirt construction whereas the one he
occupies is a concrete one. He confirms this intelligence
by looking at his map which shows the ditches to be as he
has made them out. He, therefore, heads his message,
“Concrete irrigation ditch 500 yards east of southeast
corner of Catholic Church.” This is a case where an
added word has made the meaning more proof against
error. There are similar cases where a word taken away,
or the change of a phrase, clause, or sentence, will make
the recipient of the communication more sure of the true
state of affairs.</p>

<p>To sum up as far as we have gone, we see that our
object is to put military communication into proper form;
that the failure to make our expression of the utmost
brevity and clarity causes loss of efficiency, battles, and
life; that a condition of inability to express ourselves
exists widely; that by starting as early as we can to
practice clear and brief form within the bounds of rhetorical
and military rules (which, after all, are nothing more
than those of common sense), we shall overcome this deficiency;
and that for ourselves we are going to direct our
course along two highways, viz.:</p>

<p>(1) To learn to find quickly expressions which will
cover information and decisions that are trying to struggle
into language; and</p>

<p>(2) To plant that information or decision in the recipient’s
understanding exactly as it was rooted in our
minds.</p>

<p>We have, so far, rehearsed the general attitude we must
adopt toward conquering indefinite and lengthy expression.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Because this weakness is so natural to us, we cannot
afford to trifle with it if we wish to become a factor
in battle. Positive decisions and information must be given
in a positive way. Since no other kind of decision or information
is countenanced in the military service, we must
search for specific means of having our language stand
sturdily by itself.</p>

<p>It must not choke our idea or our will, however little.
Our decisiveness must reach our farthest superior or subordinate;
and <em>words</em>, <em>phrases</em>, <em>clauses</em>, <em>sentences</em>, and
<em>paragraphs</em> are going to be our only representatives. They
alone will stand for us. Every pencil mark on that paper
will be a part of the photograph of our intelligence. Our
phraseology will be ourselves. We shall be judged by it,
and rightly so, at a time when we shall have no chance
to offer an amendment, an excuse, or an <em>I-didn’t-mean-quite-that</em>.</p>

<p>Guide-posts must mark our highways, if we are in
earnest about our destination of brevity and clarity. In
the specific hints which follow as to what to do and what
not to do, there will be no attempt to point the way to
literary effects which have entertainment for their sole
object. Our effort must be to find a practical and speedy
outlet for military information and decision through the
most unmistakable channels. But since we must be terse
and clear even to entertain, most of the rules of English
will apply here. So we must not betray surprise or anguish
when we are beset on our way by some old enemies
with whom we have wrestled in rhetorics. In meeting
them again we shall become the stronger because of the
exercise on new and professional ground. The effort to
put facts into forceful and compact form now, will create
for us such a habit of brevity and clarity that later on
we shall have room in our natural language for only such
<em>ideas</em> and <em>decisions</em> as are brief and clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>


<h3>WHAT WE MUST NOT DO</h3>


<p class="smcap noindent">As to Words.</p>

<p>1. Never use a term which depends upon the point of
view of the observer, such as <em>right</em>, <em>left</em>, <em>in front of</em>, <em>behind</em>,
<em>on this side</em>, <em>beyond</em>, and the like. Any of these directions
may be turned askew in nine cases out of ten for the hearer
or reader. Use instead <em>north</em>, <em>east</em>, etc.—the points of
the compass—designations which do not change. To give
an exact position of a place, state the <em>number of yards</em> it
lies <em>south</em>, <em>west</em>, etc., of a certain point on the map or of
a well-known object called <em>a reference point</em>.</p>

<p>Exceptions.—<em>Right</em> and <em>left</em> may be used in regard to
individuals, banks of a stream, and flanks of troops, because
their <em>rights</em> and <em>lefts</em> do not change. The right of
a man is the side on which his right arm is no matter which
way he faces; the right bank of a stream is the right as
the observer faces down stream; the right flank of a body
of troops is the right as the troops face the enemy.
(Troops in retreat are supposed to be facing the enemy.
The rear guard in reality is doing so.)</p>

<p>2. Do not use qualifying words such as, <em>sort of</em>, <em>kind
of</em>, <em>very</em>, <em>almost</em>, <em>quite</em>, <em>exceedingly</em>, <em>tremendously</em>, <em>somewhat</em>,
<em>rather</em>, <em>nearly</em>, and the like;</p>

<p>For,</p>

<p>(a). They lessen force, because they render uncertain
ideas which should be definite; and</p>

<p>(b). They mean different things to different people.
Smith’s <em>almost</em> may achieve; Jones’ <em>almost</em> may scarcely
start.</p>

<p>3. Do not use slang. There is usually a word which
will express the meaning more truthfully. “Putting it
over” may mean complete victory or a sniper’s accurate
shot. The phrase is not truthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>4. Use no abbreviations except A. M., and P. M., and
those given in Appendix 9 of our Field Service Regulations.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Noon and midnight should be written out fully.</p>

<p>5. Never use <em>he</em>, <em>it</em>, <em>this</em>, <em>him</em>, <em>her</em>, <em>their</em>, <em>them</em>, <em>that</em>,
<em>those</em>, <em>which</em>, <em>whose</em>, or the like, without looking at them
from every angle to make sure that they refer to a <em>single
word</em>. If they refer to a whole statement or to two or
more possible words, they are used wrongly. The addition
of a noun will usually fix the meaning. Suppose you were
to receive a message with this sentence in it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The platoon leader assigned to one squad the wrong objective,
and it delayed the firing.</p>
</div>

<p>Grammatically, the objective delayed the firing. Logically,
either the act of the platoon leader or the squad
delayed the firing. You make out by re-reading the whole
message that it must have been the mistake of the platoon
leader which delayed the firing. But in the meantime you
have lost three minutes, and the government has lost that
much efficiency.</p>

<p><em>And this</em> or <em>which</em> in place of “<em>and it</em>” in the message
would have made the sense no clearer. But <em>and this error</em>,
or <em>which error</em>, makes the meaning unmistakable.</p>

<p>6. Never use a participle without inspecting it to see
that it does not dangle—that it refers to the subject of
the sentence rightly. Example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Looking over the crater, the periscope of the enemy was seen
to turn.”</p>
</div>

<p>What this sentence really says is that the periscope was
looking over the crater—a very possible happening. But
all circumstances connected with the idea, after a series of
mental deductions on the part of the reader, reveal that
the writer had been looking over the crater at the periscope.
The commander who received this information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
might have been led to believe that the periscope was situated
in the crater. At least he was delayed, if not misled.</p>

<p>7. Do not use <em>and</em> except where necessary. Usually,
when we connect clauses with it, we do not mean <em>and</em>, but
some more expressive word such as <em>because</em>, <em>whereas</em>, <em>when</em>,
etc.</p>

<p>8. Do not use any word which might not mean the
same thing to any probable recipients, or might not commonly
be understood. For instance, to a southerner
<em>evening</em> means something different from its significance to
a northerner, and to an Englishman <em>clever</em> has not the
American meaning. Watch the words which have local
standards.</p>


<p class="smcap noindent">As to Phrases and Clauses.</p>

<p>1. Do not allow a phrase or a clause to string out
your expression when one word might answer. Boil your
communication to the clearest minimum.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a). We went back to headquarters with all possible speed. We
hurried to headquarters.</p>
</div>

<p>Here the specific verb <em>hurried</em> does away with your
phrase <em>with all possible speed</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(b). When we were present in the cantonment, the soldiers
looked as though they were quite hungry.</p>

<p>Our inspection of the cantonment revealed the soldiers to be
hungry.</p>
</div>

<p>Here <em>our inspection</em> does away with the clause <em>when
we were present</em>; and <em>to be hungry</em> does away with <em>as
though they were quite hungry</em>.</p>

<p>This error of spreading words is common to ordinary
writers and is most tiring and time-wasting to
readers.</p>

<p>2. Do not omit words from your phrases and clauses
where there is a chance for misunderstanding. Examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The detachment commander will be with the main body until
7 a. m. and thereafter the advance guard.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>What is really stated is that the advance guard will
be with the main body after 7 a. m.—an unintended statement.
Make your grammar accord absolutely with your
meaning. Add the <em>with</em> which belongs before <em>the advance</em>,
and notice how the sense is brought out. Again,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They order us to go to Brownsville and do impossible things.</p>
</div>

<p>In this sentence do they order us to do impossible things,
or do they themselves do impossible things?</p>

<p>Add the sign of the infinitive where it belongs before <em>do</em>.
<em>And to do impossible things</em> reads unmistakably.</p>

<p>3. Do not use a participial phrase without first inspecting
it to see that it holds but one idea.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having changed our position, the enemy was confused.</p>
</div>

<p>What this sentence really says is that the enemy, when
he had changed our position, was confused. This meaning
is evidently not intended from the very nature of the statement.</p>

<p>It is clearer and more accurate to use a finite form of
the verb instead of the participle; as,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because we changed our position we confused the enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>Or if you can condense with accuracy,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The change in our position confused the enemy.</p>
</div>


<p class="smcap noindent">As to Sentences.</p>

<p>1. Avoid long involved sentences. Even if they are
grammatically well constructed, they are liable to rhetorical
error. The following sentence because of its length
violates unity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The organization of the German army is today well known to
American Army officers, and experience has shown that German
problems and solutions of a complex character changed in translation
to conform to American units are often more troublesome for
the student to understand than the original would be, as, on account
of the difference in the size of the units, it is often necessary in
reading such a translation to go back to the German organization
in order to explain a distribution of troops, which, though simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
for a German division, would be an awkward one for a division
organized after our own Field Service Regulations.”</p>
</div>

<p>The first thought given to the reader is that “the organization
of the German army is today well known to
American Army officers.” The last thought of the sentence
is that the “explanation of a distribution of troops
would be an awkward one for a division organized after our
own Field Service Regulations.” The path from the first
thought to the second is long and winding. In fact the
two do not belong in the same sentence as the sense stands.</p>

<p>With a simple change we can make the whole easier to
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The organization of the German army is today well known to
American Army officers. Their experience has shown that German
problems and solutions of a complex character changed in translation
to conform to American units are often more troublesome for the
student to understand than the original would be. On account of the
difference in the size of the units, it is often necessary in reading
such a translation to go back to the German organization in order to
explain a distribution of troops, which, though simple for a German
division, would be an awkward one for a division organized after our
own Field Service Regulations.</p>
</div>

<p>The reader has been allowed to take in a thought at a
time instead of three thoughts at once.</p>

<p>In spite of the injunction in our Field Service Regulations
that “short sentences are easily understood,” such
long and involved expressions as the above have abounded
among military writers. In war, this continuous motion in
a single sentence has marred undertakings; in peace, it has
robbed efficiency. It has been an incubus upon general
orders, and even communications in the field.</p>

<p>CAUTION.—By short sentences we do not mean
choppy sentences—sentences unnecessarily short as,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The battalion halted for the night. It ate supper. Then the battalion
relieved the outpost.</p>
</div>

<p>Here the reader has been stopped when he should have
been kept going, for there is in reality but one thought in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the three separate sentences. They should be combined
into some such form as this,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the battalion had halted for the night and had eaten supper,
it relieved the outpost.</p>
</div>

<p>The proper relation of ideas is here expressed for the
reader. He knows that the relief of the outpost is the
main consideration, depending in point of time upon the
halt and supper. And the whole thought is not too big
for him to take in as he reads.</p>

<p>The first error, illustrated by the sentence concerning
German organization, is a fault common to older writers.
They have allowed themselves to grow into the habit of
adding qualifying phrases and clauses to sentences already
completed until their additions come to swamp the originals.
The second error, illustrated by the sentence concerning
the battalion relieving the outpost, is a fault
common to young writers. They have not yet formed the
habit of relating in their own minds the separate ideas
of a complete thought.</p>

<p>The happy mean between these two indefinite extremes
is the one we wish to find—the sentence that gives speedy
and accurate intelligence.</p>

<p>2. Do not use compound sentences containing <em>and</em>,
save where they cannot be avoided. Here is a common
piece of slovenliness found in such a construction.—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The wagon trains pulled out and the troops ate breakfast.</p>
</div>

<p>Any one of the following is more definite.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the wagon trains pulled out the troops ate breakfast.</p>

<p>The wagon trains pulled out before the troops ate breakfast.</p>

<p>As the wagon trains pulled out the troops ate breakfast.</p>
</div>

<p>The writer in the first instance was too lazy or stupid
to think out the specific meaning of <em>and</em> for the reader.</p>

<p>Remember, also, that the use of <em>and</em> to connect clauses
leads us into the treacherous “run-on sentences”—the sentence
that flits from subject to subject like an old gossip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They fell into the trap and so the commanding officer’s orders
were lost and they remained there twenty days and were finally
removed to a prison camp and there winter soon came on and finally
they were released and went home in the spring.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sentence, in addition to having too many ideas in it,
has them unrelated.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE MUST DO</h3>


<p class="smcap noindent">As to Words.</p>

<p>1. Every geographical name must be printed in capitals,
thus,—</p>

<p>WEST POINT, MARNE RIVER, PARIS.</p>

<p>This rule does not mean that the names must be printed,
merely, but that every letter must be capitalized legibly.</p>

<p>If the place be not pronounced as it is spelled, it should
appear thus,—XENIA (Zē′-nĭ-ä), POUGHKEEPSIE
(Pṓ-kĭp′-sĭ), CHIHUAHUA (Chḗ-wä′-wä).</p>

<p>A road must be designated by enough points to make
it unmistakable along the entire course considered; thus:—</p>

<p>BIGLERVILLE—582—CENTER MILLS. (See map,
A-8 and 7.) The 582 inserted in this case keeps the course
from being confused with the turn-off toward GUERNSEY.
If the course were intended to lie through GUERNSEY,
the road would appear thus,—</p>

<p>BIGLERVILLE—GUERNSEY—CENTER MILLS.</p>

<p>2. Use the words of one syllable preferably. You will
find that the longer words come to you more readily but
are usually more hazy in meaning. You will gain vigor
and clearness by the cultivation of Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>3. Do not connect two sentences by a comma; for example:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The phrase does not imply motion, thus it would mean nothing to
say that the battery is advancing on the line Twins-Concrete Ford.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>The error here is not so much one of punctuation as of
sentence idea. Somehow, the thought does not run
smoothly. We find that two separate thoughts without
much relationship have been compressed into a single sentence—into
something which should be a complete whole,
and go from capital to period without break. Oftentimes,
by showing this relationship, we may bring the idea within
bounds of a single sentence; for example:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since the phrase does not imply motion, it would mean nothing
to say that the battery is advancing on the line, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>4. Watch the position of your adverbs. When you
mean,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We captured almost all the ammunition,</p>
</div>

<p>Do not say,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We almost captured all the ammunition.</p>
</div>

<p>The first means that we captured at least a part of the
ammunition; the second means that we were close to success,
but failed to capture ammunition.</p>

<p>5. Use the words <em>head</em> and <em>tail</em> when speaking of a
column of troops. The head is the leading element and the
tail is the other end, no matter in which direction the
column happens to be facing.</p>

<p>6. In the newspaper or book that you are reading,
every time you meet a new word make it yours. Look up
the meaning in the dictionary until you are sure that you
know how to use the word.</p>

<p>At the first opportunity, employ it in your conversation
or writing. Sooner or later “dope” and the eternal
“damn” will have ceased to fill in endless crevices in your
talk and their places will have been taken by incisive words.
You will awake to find that you are expressing yourself
more easily and plainly. On the other hand, every word
you pass over or for which you merely consult the dictionary,
is a tool cast aside in your building of an officer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Every bit of slang or profanity which now crowds out the
appropriate word will later rise up and clog your thought
at a time when you are making your utmost endeavor to
put into clear, forceful English your plan of action or
your order.</p>


<p class="smcap noindent">As to Phrases and Clauses.</p>

<p>Remember to place phrases and clauses nearest the
words they modify.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Captain George will divide the tools equally among the battalions
<em>which are fit for felling timber</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The change of the italicized clause to its proper position
next the word <em>tools</em>, gives the intended meaning.</p>


<p class="smcap noindent">As to Sentences.</p>

<p>1. Use the short complex sentence; such as:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An attack is expected tomorrow from strong hostile forces
whose advanced troops are near FORT MONTGOMERY.</p>

<p>The enemy’s infantry disappeared to the south as soon as our
advance cavalry came over the hill.</p>
</div>

<p>The use of <em>when</em>, <em>since</em>, <em>because</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>whenever</em>, <em>although</em>,
<em>after</em>, <em>till</em>, <em>until</em>, <em>as</em>, <em>so long as</em>, <em>now that</em>, <em>whence</em>,
<em>whither</em>, <em>inasmuch as</em>, <em>that</em>, <em>in order that</em>, <em>so that</em>, and <em>lest</em>,
with the finite form of the verb is a good construction to
practice.</p>

<p>Notice how compact and explicit is the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lest the enemy should turn your flank, keep veering to the east.</p>
</div>

<p>Try to put this same thought into twelve words by
means of a different construction.</p>

<p>2. When you start with one kind of construction, keep
it up unless there be some good reason to change it. If
you begin with the past tense and third person, have the
past tense and third person continue throughout the sentence
or sentences.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is reported that extensive preparations are being made in the
vicinity of CAMBRAI and the enemy has stored railroad material
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>It is reported that the enemy has made extensive preparations
at <ins class="corr" id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Cambrai and has'">

</div>

<p>Which sentence reads along with less break?</p>

<p>Again,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is advisable to advance part of the ammunition columns and
that the division should follow at 200 yards.</p>
</div>

<p>Better,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is advisable to advance part of the ammunition columns and
to have the division follow at 200 yards.</p>
</div>

<p>Now that specific guides have been posted near the grammatical
turns of the road, let us look at two general rules
covering everything we do.</p>

<p>1. <em>Write legibly.</em>—Rain, wear in the pocket, dim and
fading lights, and crumpled paper are going to make
havoc of your orders and messages in war time. Your
commanding officer must be able to make out your script
as well as your meaning. Now is the moment to make your
handwriting a size or two larger and noticeably plainer.</p>

<p>2. <em>Inspect the form.</em> After you have written your
ideas legibly, <em>look at them searchingly to see that they
mean only what you intend</em>.</p>

<p>You cannot be too cold-blooded about this act for two
reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is a habit which is strong upon
us. We have all been too prone to state a thing haphazardly,
and then to exclaim, “You know what I mean!”
The person addressed, of course, is not going to acknowledge
that he has not the brains to understand; so the
jumble is never smoothed out. Thus in nine-tenths of our
off-hand moments we have been accustomed to say what
we do <em>not</em> mean. The habit is so strong that when we find
ourselves dealing with matters of life and death, we are
still liable to whisper to ourselves, “O, well, he’ll get it.”
The result is that the part of the order, message, or report,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
which struck us as having our usual clearness, is a puzzle
to the recipient.</p>

<p>In the second place, the impression has grown up in the
minds of many that substance, no matter how it is mixed,
is all that is necessary. There has come about a certain
proud disregard of the <em>manner</em> in which a thing is expressed.
Too many technical books have failed of their
purpose because the writer, although he was an expert
in his line, did not know how to present his subject in an
attractive form. In the same way explanations have
failed upon the drill ground, and lectures have made excellent
tacticians appear like school-boys. The very manner
of communication has not only spoiled the taste for
the subject matter but has hindered its absorption. His
audience has not understood his explanation.</p>

<p>In inspecting your work, take the attitude that the
recipient is skeptical of everything you have said.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is assumed that you wish to fasten in your mind
everything in this chapter. The following method is suggested
as the best short-cut:</p>

<p>1. Make an outline of the whole chapter, expressing
the main idea of each paragraph and sub-paragraph in
two or three words.</p>

<p>2. Close your books.</p>

<p>3. With the aid of your outline see whether you can
call to your mind everything the paragraph or sub-paragraph
means.</p>

<br>
<span class="fs90">MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS</span></h2>


<p>The following are the various types of military communication:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Field messages</span> convey verbal or written information
by messenger or wire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reports</span> are written accounts of some enterprise, undertaking,
or event, such as a reconnaissance, march, or
battle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">War diaries</span> are daily records of events kept during
campaign by each battalion and higher organization.
From the entries in these diaries the facts of our military
history are obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Letters of instruction</span>, issued by higher commanders,
regulate in a general way movements covering much time
and space. Army and Corps commanders may, by visits
and conferences, often communicate verbally the substance
of letters of instruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Field orders</span>, issued verbally or in writing by commanders
of tactical units, regulate the tactical actions of
troops, and such strategical actions as are not covered
by letters of instruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General orders</span> are written directions having to do
with the general administration of a command. They contain
the necessary details for carrying out injunctions
from higher authority, for keeping up standing instructions,
and for publishing results of special and general
courts-martial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orders</span> (when not used as a general term) refer to the
instructions communicated to troops by commanders of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
divisions and of separate brigades in regard to combat,
field, ammunition, supply, sanitary, and engineer trains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Special orders</span> cover such matters in regard to individuals
as are not necessary to be communicated to the entire
command.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Operation orders</span>, as we now use the term in reference
to trench warfare, are the orders governing a certain
enterprise along a given sector of the front. Although
they are even more precise than field orders, they contain
more details on account of the wide difference between
trench and open warfare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Circulars</span> are printed from time to time by various
bureaus and departments of the War Department, and
by purchasing officers, for the publication of data pertaining
to the business of a bureau or department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulletins</span> publish, usually in pamphlet form, information
for the military service.</p>

<p>Both <em>circulars</em> and <em>bulletins</em> have the force of orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Memoranda</span> are published from time to time by commanding
officers to embody directions not vital or sweeping
enough for general or special orders. <em>Memoranda</em>
have the force of orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Official correspondence</span> consists of official letters,
returns, rolls, estimates, requisitions, and certain routine
reports.</p>

<p>These types of communication have been defined in order
to give a general survey of the many kinds of written and
oral expression of which military men should become
masters. Although the task appears huge, proficiency
can be gained by attention to the hints suggested in
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>.</p>

<p>In order to apply those suggestions in a practical way,
we must now sort out from all of the above types those
which should press themselves most upon our attention.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Certainly all these types cannot be equally necessary for
our immediate study. Possibly if we classify them from
the point of view of the occasion for their use, we may see
more clearly how to treat them.</p>

<p>It is evident that we are going to have to write messages,
field orders, and operation orders when the enemy is upon
us, and when every second is vital. If we must stop in
that crisis and putter over the forms and methods of drafting
our thoughts, how useless we shall be! When that
time comes, one thing alone should occupy our conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
thought—our military idea. That will be sufficient to keep
busy the most brilliant intellect.</p>

<p>In order that we shall have, then, perfect freedom to
grapple with tactical, strategical, or logistical difficulties
on the field of battle, let us learn the forms and methods of
messages, field orders, and operation orders as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>In so doing we shall discover two things,—</p>

<p>(1) That messages, field orders, and operation orders
have a bearing upon each other in the sequence given, and</p>

<p>(2) That the work of framing them will give us the
greatest possible practice in writing all other types of
communication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The message.</span>—The general term <em>message</em> may refer
to (1) any informal or short communication, (2) any
directions or orders too abbreviated to be known as field
orders, or (3) any piece of information transmitted in
the presence of the enemy.</p>

<p>Number 1 is too broad for treatment here. Moreover,
the ready skill in composing anything of its nature should
follow easily from what we are about to practice.</p>

<p>Number 2 is to be considered in connection with field
orders.</p>

<p>Number 3, then, is the important one for us to take up
now. From its definition it is already familiar to us as</p>


<h3>THE FIELD MESSAGE</h3>

<p>Since it deals entirely with the communication of information,
it might be well to inquire from what sources this
information is to be derived, in order that we may know
something about the kind of material with which we are
going to deal. Just as a stenographer acquaints herself
with some of the workings of her employer’s business in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
order to attain the greatest amount of usefulness, so we
should now look over the vast amount of territory which
the contents of field messages cover in order to gain the
maximum efficiency in composing these communications.
Accordingly, we find that higher commanders, adjoining
troops, inhabitants of the country, newspapers, letters,
telegraph files, prisoners, deserters, spies, maps, and reconnaissances,
are all sources of valuable military information.
It is from these that we shall obtain our data.</p>

<p>Most of all, however, will the fighting man obtain his
from reconnaissance—the work of gathering information
in the field. From the moment of entering the theatre
of operations to that of abandoning it, there is necessary
a constant quest of knowledge of the enemy’s composition,
morale, material, disposition, and activities. No leader
can act intelligently without this information, and, since
he cannot hope to get it in person, he must depend
for its acquisition upon certain reconnaissance units, chief
of which is the patrol.</p>

<p>Our concern with these reconnaissance units lies in the
fact that the information which they gather must be sent
to the commander by messages. If no one in the patrol is
capable of sending back accurate and timely written information,
the reconnaissance has failed, and the patrol
might as well have remained in camp. The good field message
is the strong link between the reconnoitering party
and the main body. The poor field message is a gap which
no amount of courageous effort in ferreting out facts from
a wary enemy will bridge. The ideal reconnaissance, then,
is one which keeps a constant stream of accurate and reliable
messages flowing back to the proper recipient.</p>

<p>The main factors which go to make up accuracy and
reliability of field messages are keen observation and faithful
expression. Both of these faculties can be cultivated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
and indeed are so closely allied that they ought to be considered
together. It is quite difficult at times to tell where
one leaves off and the other begins. If a man puts in his
message, “The enemy was seen over the hill,” and another,
witnessing the same occurrence, states that “seven hostile
infantrymen lay down on the military crest of hill 307
at 4-17 p. m.,” which one has keenly observed? Which
one has faithfully expressed himself? Is it possible that
the first man did not see any of the details of the second
message? Or did he fail to put them down faithfully?
In whatever way we answer these questions, we are brought
to the realization that the second man applied both faculties
to an equal extent. And, therefore, we are led to the
conclusion that from the standpoint of complete expression
we must take things quickly, precisely, and accurately,
and put them out certainly, specifically, concretely,
unmistakably, and faithfully.</p>

<p>The field message is not used by the reconnaissance unit
exclusively. An exchange of communications might be
necessary between commanders to tell of changing conditions.
The enemy has developed an unexpected attack,
reinforcements are urgently needed, etc. This message will
differ slightly in form from the ordinary field message
which will be analysed below, but it will be of the same
essential type, and will make the same demands upon
brevity and clearness.</p>


<h3>FORMS FOR FIELD MESSAGES</h3>

<p>The Infantry Drill Regulations state that “the authorized
message book should be used and the form therein adhered
to.” This book, issued by the Signal Corps, contains fifty
message blanks with fifty duplicating sheets, so that fifty
messages may be sent and a copy of each retained. The
front of the blank appears as on next page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>The back of the blank is divided into squares. By means
of a ratio between the size of these squares and certain
scales for maps, a fairly accurate sketch is possible.</p>


<p class="noindent"><em>Caution.</em></p>

<p>Remember that a message may not always go direct
from sender to receiver, but may be relayed by several
methods of communications—buzzer, helio, or flag. Think
how errors may creep in at each change of method, and
guard against them by making your message one of telegraphic
brevity and unmistakable clearness.</p>

<p>By means of this sketch, the message may often be
shortened, for the sender can refer by letter or number
to various points on the sketch, whereas he would otherwise
be compelled to describe positions or to go into detail
at length. When he does draw a sketch, he should
refer to it somewhere on the bottom of the face of the message

<p>The form of address of the regulation envelope for this

an extract from paragraph 36, Field Service Regulations,
which reads as follows: “Messages carried by a messenger
are usually enclosed in envelopes properly addressed. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
envelope when not marked ‘confidential’ is left unsealed,
so that commanders along the line of march may read the
contents. Upon the envelope is written the name of the
messenger, his time of departure, and rate of speed. The
last is indicated as follows: Ordinary, rapid, or urgent.
Ordinary means five miles an hour for a mounted man;
rapid, about 7 or 8 miles an hour; and urgent, the highest
speed consistent with certainty of arrival at destination.
The recipient notes the time of receipt upon the envelope
and returns the latter to bearer.”</p>

<p>We should certainly be armed with a Field Message
Book when the crucial moment for writing a message arrives.
But it so happens, especially in open warfare, that
that article of equipment may have been left in the saddlebags,
or have been borrowed by a friend. At any rate
it is not present for duty when we want it. However, we
are always able to produce a piece of paper or clothing—something
upon which to write—from someone of the
party present. It behooves us, then, to learn to compose
a message without the aid of a blank. Indeed, this idea is
contained in the latter part of the quotation from the
Infantry Drill Regulations—“and the form therein adhered
to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>We are not compelled to memorize the form of the Field
Message Blank. We can, however, analyse it so that it
will fix itself in our memory and will be a part of what we
must know in regard to the field order. And we can gain
a knowledge of this form rather by adhering to the field
message blank than by departing from it. Yet we need
not know its entire form but simply what contents are
necessary and what order they must have.</p>

<p>In the first place the field message may be divided into
three parts:</p>

<p class="noindent pad10pc">
<span class="smcap">The Heading</span>,<br>
<span class="smcap">The Body</span>,<br>
<span class="smcap">The Ending</span>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heading</span> should contain:</p>

<p class="noindent pad10pc">
<span class="smcap">The Name of Sending Detachment</span>,<br>
<span class="smcap">The Location of Sending Detachment</span> (<span class="smcap">Place</span>),<br>
<span class="smcap">The Date</span>,<br>
<span class="smcap">The Hour of Issue</span>,<br>
<span class="smcap">The Number of the Message</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>For example, the whole heading would appear something
like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1 right padr2">Combat Patrol, 318th Infantry,</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">Cross Roads 500 yds. south of CLINTON SCHOOL HOUSE.<br>
No. 3. <span class="pad30pc">9 Jan. 18. <span class="pad20pc">9-45 p. m.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">Location of sending detachment means the <em>exact spot</em>
upon which sender is located at time of writing.</p>

<p>The date should be given always as above in the
sequence, day, month, year. This combination prevents
the numerals from being confused. In naming a night
both days should be mentioned thus: Night 4/5 Feb. 18.</p>

<p>The time should always have the dash between the hour
and minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Messages sent on the same day from the same sending
detachment are numbered consecutively. Each day or
each mission starts a new series.</p>

<p>If a map referred to is not the one on the reverse side
of the message, the sender should designate the name or
number of the map used, immediately below the number of
the message.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Body</span> of the message contains the following:</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">
<span class="smcap">To Whom Sent</span>,<br>
<span class="smcap">The Body Proper</span>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Body Proper</span> has the following sequence for its
information:</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">
1. <span class="smcap">Enemy.</span><br>
2. <span class="smcap">Your Own Troops.</span><br>
3. <span class="smcap">Terrain.</span><br>
4. <span class="smcap">Your Plan.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The body then would appear something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To Commanding Officer, Advance Guard, 71st Brigade:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; Squadron of enemy’s cavalry encamped in meadow 600
yards southeast of here. Our officer’s patrol, which we
met at ZION CHURCH at 8-10 a. m., reported two regiments
enemy’s infantry intrenched at railroad one mile
south of here. Tail of our second battalion at PARKSBURG
steel bridge 7-20 a. m. Battalion was marching
south. MARTIN’S CREEK unfordable at any point between
SMITH’S CORNERS and GREENSBURG. Will
move southeast from here along creek bed in order to complete
mission.”</p>
</div>

<p>On account of lack of space, paragraphing is impossible:
but if this sequence is followed the thought is easily
gained. If some one of our own troops tells us concerning
the enemy, this information should come between 1
and 2, and should be definitely shown to be hearsay and not
our own observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Of course, all of the parts, 1, 2, 3, and 4, do not always
occur. The order is nevertheless followed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ending</span> consists of</p>

<p class="pad4 smcap">The Signature</p>

<p class="noindent">which, in turn, consists of the sender’s surname and his
rank, thus,</p>

<p class="right fs90">
<span class="padr6">FLETCHER,</span><br>
<span class="padr4">SGT.</span></p>

<p>The outline of the whole message construction, then,
would be as follows:—</p>

<span class="fs90">PROBLEMS IN THE COMPOSITION OF
THE FIELD MESSAGE</span></h2>


<p>“An intrinsically good tactical exercise,” says Griepenkerl,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
“loses by <em>faulty composition</em> and careless or illegible
handwriting.... A rambling mode of expression, a
long-winded, elaborate style, is unmilitary. Therefore,
test your order to see whether you cannot cross out some
superfluous word, or whether you cannot think of some
shorter and more suitable mode of expression; <em>grudge
every word</em>.”</p>

<p>But he goes on to say in another place that clearness
takes precedence over brevity; “therefore, rather use a
long expression where a shorter one might be misunderstood.
<em>Brevity must never lead to superficiality.</em>”</p>

<p>Griepenkerl was speaking of orders. Yet our Field Service
Regulations state that “most of the rules adopted to
secure clearness in orders apply equally to messages.”</p>

<p>In the following problems which are designed for practice
in framing field messages, we should adhere not only
to Griepenkerl’s advice, but also to the hints, forms, and
cautions of Chapters I and II. Remember that each time
a faulty form or expression is used, some commanding
officer is halted or hindered, retarded or confused. The
highest premium should be placed upon correct form and
expression.</p>

<p>With the selection of material from the purposely misleading
and sometimes ill-stated problems below, you may,
however, have difficulty. Certainly all of the long narrative,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
often in soldier jargon, cannot be placed in the
message. Some facts must be eliminated as unessential.
What you should let your commanding officer know can be
determined sometimes only by technical experience. However,
Major General Morrison’s<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> caution along this line
should be repeated here for your help: “We all recognize
the fact that, as a rule, the sooner information reaches
headquarters, the more valuable it is. But this applies
only to information which really has value. If you are in
doubt as to whether or not information would be valuable,
give headquarters the benefit of the doubt and send it in.”
So you see that if you are not quite decided about stating
a detail, it is better to give the information than to withhold
it. Therefore, exclude only those items which would
on the ground of common sense be pointless.</p>

<p>In extracting and writing your messages from the problems
given, it will be assumed that you do not know
whether or not the recipient is provided with a map
similar to your own. It may be taken for granted, however,
that he is acquainted with the names which appear on
your map.</p>

<p>It may also be assumed that you have drawn a sketch
on the reverse side of your message sheet.</p>

<p>In reading your map the signs and abbreviations, explained
in Appendix 4, Field Service Regulations, will aid
you.</p>

<p>A scale of yards is at the bottom (the south) of your
map. By the use of a slip of paper, distances in yards may
be measured off from place to place.</p>

<p>Wherever it is stated in these problems that a person
writes a message, the student should construct that same
message. In so doing:</p>

<p>(1) Assemble your information in proper sequence,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>(2) Give it proper and unmistakable expression, and</p>

<p>(3) Inspect it thoroughly in order to be positive that
you have given it proper sequence, and proper and unmistakable
expression.</p>

<p><em>Hold yourself strictly accountable for every expression
which could be put into better form.</em></p>

<p>Caution.—The hour in the heading of message is the
<em>time</em> of <em>signature</em>.</p>


<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>1. On January 27, 1926, you are Corporal Peck in
charge of a reconnoitering patrol from the advance guard
of the third battalion of the 177th regiment of Infantry.
You are proceeding along the road east to Hunterstown
from 549 (D, 5 and 6). You arrive at the east edge of
J. Bell’s orchard when you see several men at the zero in
602. With the aid of your field glasses you make out four
field pieces and limbers to be turning to the north off the
road just opposite to, and south of, the men. The vehicles
soon disappear behind the knoll of 602. You can see that
the men are wearing the enemy’s uniform. After five
minutes of observation, the men go out of sight on the far
side of the hill, and nothing further happens. After you
have written your message at half past four o’clock in
the afternoon, you travel under cover of the creek and
fields in the general direction of Henderson Meeting
House, in the hope of finding out more about the force in
the vicinity of 602.</p>

<p>2. On August 27, 1920, you are Sergeant Fenton of a
left flank patrol sent out from the second battalion (27th
Infantry) which is marching north, as an advance guard
to its regiment, toward 546 from Hunterstown. As you
come out into the open to the west of the J. Bell farm
house, you receive a volley from about twenty rifles from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the woods at the north. Two of your men are killed.
With the remainder of your men you retire hastily under
cover of the Bell orchard to the stream bed which you
follow to the north until half way between the Bell house
and the “R” in Beaverdam. There you go through the
fields to the west until you get a glimpse of the high ground
in the vicinity of 574. You can make out through the
corn-rows infantrymen deployed and lying down facing
you. They extend along the fence for fifty yards on each
side of the dirt road. You can see a field piece half way
between the ends of the fence and at the edge of the woods.
You go back to where you left the stream and write your
message. You hand it to one of your men at 20 minutes
past two in the afternoon for delivery. You then crawl
forward leaving your men under cover in the stream, and
remain in observation in the corn-field.</p>

<p>3. You are 1st Sergeant James in charge of a combat
patrol from the 38th Infantry which is on outpost duty
for the 8th Division at Granite Hill (5, bottom). In
passing the house at 5-E the farmer tells you that yesterday
at noon he saw about one hundred and fifty saddle-horses
in a lot near the cross-roads in Hunterstown. On
questioning him further he tells you that there were quite
a lot of soldiers about, having a good time, and wearing
the enemy’s uniform. You keep on your course. When
you arrive at the orchard near 603 it is after nightfall.
You hear voices and laughing at the northern edge of the
orchard just south of the “6” in 603. You sneak up
until you can make out four of the enemy’s infantrymen
sitting about a little fire. You charge with bayonets fixed,
kill three and capture one. He is half drunk on apple-jack
and talks freely. He says his brigade is in bad shape,
has marched four days and nights without stopping, has
a big outpost at Woodside School House, and that he himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
is with a bunch of the advance cavalry in the town.
At a quarter of ten at night you hand your message to a
member of your patrol for delivery. You then proceed
along the road toward 549, looking for more information.
You arrive there, having seen nothing of value, the next
day at 7 a. m., July 18, 1940.</p>

<p>4. On June 21, 1920, you are a first lieutenant in
charge of an officer’s patrol from the 80th Cavalry which
is operating as Independent Cavalry for the 190th Division.
It is six o’clock in the evening when as you are
riding along the road from Texas to Biglerville, three of
the enemy jump out upon you. In the struggle which
ensues the three are overpowered and sabred by your
superior force. You search the dead men, but find nothing
upon them but ornaments indicating they belong to the
27th Cavalry. You dismount, tie your horses in the orchard
near the word Stiner, and proceed with two of your
men along the railroad track toward Biglerville. Near 626
you look toward the town to find the space between you
and it well dotted with tents. Placing your men well
under cover in the woods, you lie down in the culvert at
626. Before taps is blown in the enemy’s camp, from conversations
which have gone on in your vicinity, you have
learned that a regiment of cavalry has been encamped
there for two days, that no other force is about, and that
the regiment will move out at five the next morning, marching
toward Goldenville. You write your message at 9:15
p. m. After it is sent, you take up your position again in
the culvert.</p>

<p>5. On the 19th of February, 1940, a visiting patrol in
charge of Corporal Eaton sent out from 2d Battalion,
which is acting as outpost for the 81st Infantry, is on its
way to a picket of friendly troops. Its route lies from
Boyd School House, E-8 toward McElheny. As it approaches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the bridge near the 4 in the 480 contour, it
hears footsteps of men hurrying into the timber to the
east. The suspicions of the patrol being aroused, it looks
about and discovers loose earth scattered over the snow
at the abutments of the bridge; upon further investigation
it finds fuses leading from the center of the pile of fresh
earth. The message is finished on the spot at exactly midnight.
After the messenger has departed the corporal
and one man remain on guard over the mines whose fuses
were cut before the messenger left.</p>

<p>6. You are Corporal Peters sent out with a visiting
patrol from Company A, 2d Battalion of your regiment.
Your company is Support number 2 of the outpost at the
“K” in Oak Ridge, E-8. As you approach Boyd School
House, you are not challenged as you expect. You hurry
on to where the sentry of the picket should be posted at
the cross-roads, only to find him dead of a bayonet thrust.
You go to the south side of the school house and there find
the remainder of the picket in their blankets in the same
condition. You put your hand on one of the men and find
that his body is still warm. At fifteen minutes to three,
September 30, 1932, you complete your message at the
spot where you found most of the picket dead. You then
take your remaining man with you and together perform
double sentry duty at the cross-roads.</p>

<p>7. On July 4, 1925, you are Sergeant Black in charge
of an harassing patrol sent out from the 68th regiment of
Infantry which is acting as outpost for the 12th Division.
At a quarter to twelve at night, you have just fired two
volleys from Boyd School House in the direction of Oak
Ridge, and are proceeding toward C. Topper’s to do the
same there, when, as you cross the railroad one hundred
yards south of the “r” in Topper, you stumble upon a
wagon wheel imbedded in the earth. Cautious inspection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
reveals four howitzers camouflaged. With the aid of
known measurements upon your hand you find that the
calibre of each is 6 inches. You finish a message at a
quarter to one and then proceed as you intended.</p>

<p>8. On the 21st of August, 1919, you are Sergeant
Stuart sent out in charge of a contact patrol from the
99th Infantry acting as outpost of the 32d Brigade.
After hard work during which you are nearly captured at
the cemetery near Henderson Meeting House, you arrive
with your patrol, at ten minutes to nine in the evening, at
601 just west of Hunterstown. A regiment of the enemy’s
infantry has been defeated by your troops during the day
and it is your duty to find out what you can about the
enemy’s whereabouts and intentions. As you look across
to the west you see lights in the fields between R. Smith’s
farm house and J. Bell’s. You make your way carefully
down the hill to the farm house at D-6. As you lie in the
edge of the woods nearest the house you count fifteen rows
of tents by the glow from the fires. You see no animals or
picket lines. The fires die down shortly and the talking
ceases. You take turns on watch with the senior man of
your patrol. At a quarter to one while you are on watch,
fires begin to spring up at the ends of the company streets.
Shortly afterwards a young soldier comes to the nearby
farm house to get water. He grumbles loudly that he
must get up in the middle of the night and complains that
the first sergeant has ordered the company to be in ranks
at one fifty. You get your message off at five minutes
after one and remain in observation of the camp.</p>

<p>9. (Two messages.) On May 31, 1940, you are Corporal
Decker in charge of a reconnoitering patrol from
the 71st Regiment of Cavalry acting as Advance Cavalry
to the 18th Division. You are proceeding toward Heidlersburg
from Friends’ Grove School House, and you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
arrive at 5-A. When, proceeding to the east, you are half
way through the woods, you hear hoof-beats on the road
to the north. Having proceeded due east, you now arrive
at the edge of the woods. There you see several mounted
men of the enemy halted near the road fork 545, but the
trees in the ravine make it difficult for you to see them
clearly. Near the main cross-roads of the town you see
a hundred or more dismounted men holding their horses.
After watching them for a few moments you realize that
the horses are being watered. At five minutes to five you
start to write your message where you are. After sending
it off you remain to see what is going to happen further.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past five, the mounted men ride west with
an advance guard of about a troop. Your patrol was well
concealed so that it was able to time the main body as it
trotted past the road fork 578 in column of twos. It took
two minutes and a half to pass. The group near 545 that
appeared to be a patrol has disappeared. While the larger
body was passing road fork 578 you heard firing about a
mile to the south by less than a dozen rifles. You begin to
send a message at a quarter after five and start to return
to your command. (100 cavalrymen in column of twos
will trot past a given point in one minute.)</p>

<span class="fs90">MORE PROBLEMS ON THE COMPOSITION
OF THE FIELD MESSAGE</span></h2>


<p>1. (Three messages.) On July 18, 1930, you are
Corporal Flint in charge of a reconnoitering patrol sent
out from the 61st Infantry which is acting as Rear Guard
to the 19th Brigade, and which is withdrawing from
Goldenville through Table Rock. As you proceed south
along the stream which flows past Herman, 500 yds. south
of C-7, you stumble upon one of your own regiment seriously
wounded and lying at the “V” in Varney, in the open
field. He tells you that a regiment of Cavalry of the enemy
passed by the nearest farm house going northeast on the
dirt road when the sun was overhead. You ask the people
of the farm house, who are manifestly in sympathy with
the enemy, what they know about the occurrence, but they
refuse to answer. On the road are many fresh hoof-marks.
You begin to write your message at the Varney
farm house at half past three in the afternoon. When you
have finished you proceed southwest along the same road
and along the creek bed toward the race-track. At the
bottom part of the “S” in Stock Farm, you leave your men
in the field under cover and go south along the edge of the
main road toward Boyd School House. You see several
patrols of the enemy but you press on. You have not gone
far, however, before you spy a low heavy cloud of dust
ahead which seems to be moving toward you. At the Boyd
School House Cross Roads it turns west at twenty-five
minutes to six. It takes the column, which you now make
out to be infantry in column of squads, three minutes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
forty seconds to pass the cross-roads (175 Infantry in
column of squads can pass a given point in one minute).
Since the patrols of the enemy are becoming rather thick,
you decide to make your way back to the “K” in Stock
Farm. There you finish writing another message at a
quarter after seven. You have scarcely sent it off when
there is a noise among the corn-stalks near you. You lie
low and have your men, whom you have now collected
about you, do the same. A friendly uniform appears
through one of the corn-rows; it is just light enough for
you to make it out. You give a low whistle and signal at
which the wearer of the uniform approaches. He turns
out to be Sergeant Black of your regiment who is leading
a combat patrol. He tells you that he counted twenty
passenger coaches hitched together on the railroad to the
southwest. The engine was pointed toward the north and
opposite the “r” in C. Topper at four o’clock. The
enemy’s soldiers were crowding around trying to hurry
into the coaches. After the Sergeant leaves you, you try
to make your way back to your company. At a quarter
to twelve you have arrived under cover of the fields and
woods near the road-fork 646 just south of Hamilton
when you hear the rumble of wheels close behind you to
the south. One of your men counted twelve pieces of
light artillery which turned off the road and unlimbered
just south of 664. You begin to write another message at
the “n” in Hamilton at 5 minutes after twelve.</p>

<p>2. On September 1, 1927, you are a first lieutenant of
Infantry in charge of an expeditionary patrol from the
26th Infantry, which is acting as outpost to the 18th Division.
The outpost is covering the general sector from
Stiner, 1,000 yards north of Texas, to Bender’s Church,
B-7. The Division is encamped between Biglerville and
Guernsey. Your patrol leaves the outermost picket near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Table Rock at three o’clock in the afternoon. Its mission
is to capture a strong officer’s patrol of the enemy which
is supposed to be proceeding north along the railroad from
Hamilton. You conceal yourself and your patrol in the
shrubbery near the railroad bridge south of Table Rock
Station. At five minutes after four you hear footsteps
and subdued talking to the south. You allow the first two
men to pass you, and when the main body of the patrol is
near the bridge you spring out upon them with bayonets.
The mêlée lasts for about three minutes. Four men finally
survive—the leader of their patrol, two of your men, and
yourself. Because of the wound of the foreign officer,
whom you make out by his insignia to be a staff officer of
their 132d Regiment of Engineers and a Captain, you
decide that you will be unable to risk bringing in your
prisoner at once. You question him as to what he has
been doing and he tells you that he has been all day on the
road and that his regiment has marched for three days
from the south without stopping to pitch camp. He will
answer no other questions. You bind and gag him, after
you have taken him into the field to the bottom of the “S”
in Table Rock Station. There you start to write your
message twelve minutes after the end of the fight. After
you have sent off the communication you and the one
remaining man keep guard over your prisoner.</p>

<p>3. (Six messages.) On October 29, 1945, you are
Sergeant Murray sent out in charge of a strong reconnoitering
patrol from the 82d Infantry which is acting as
Advance Guard to the 34th Brigade. You send a message
from Mt. Olivet School House (7-top) that the country
is clear of the enemy from there back to Center Mills from
which you have come. You finish your message at half
past one in the afternoon. At ten minutes after two, from
the main cross-roads of Guernsey, you start another message<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
in which you let your Commanding Officer know that
you have seen nothing of the enemy, and that the roads
have been patrolled to a distance of eight hundred yards
on each side. You keep on going south along the railroad.
As the first two men of your patrol enter the railroad
cut five hundred yards south of the main cross-roads
of Guernsey, they receive a volley from the top and west
side of the embankment. They back out while you with
the remainder of your patrol skirt the top of the cut to the
west. Three men run to the west into the fields and woods.
Your fire does not reach them. You continue to scour the
country as far as the stream. At five minutes to three you
begin to write a message from the farm house near the
southern exit of the cut. You then proceed south along
the railroad as before. As you approach Biglerville you
try to see through your field glasses any signs of the
enemy’s men or wagons which might be in the town. Seeing
none, you go carefully and completely around the village
back to your starting point. Two of your men then enter
the main street from the east. After investigating the
first eight or ten houses, they signal you to approach.
You then with your patrol go along every street of the
town, go into the main stores and houses, but you can
find no trace of the enemy. At 20 minutes to five you
finish your message at the cross-roads five hundred yards
southwest of the “B” in Biglerville. You then take the
main Carlisle road and proceed south on it. As you go
you inspect all bridges, railroad tracks, streams, and
ground in general for eight hundred yards on either side
of the road, but find no enemy. At twenty-five minutes to
six you begin your message at the Stiner House. Before
you now go south, you investigate for eight hundred yards
the roads leading to the east and west from the main cross-roads
south of Stiner. After your men return you proceed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
along the side of the road south toward the stream.
As you come up to the bridge, although it is getting dusk
you see a sentinel on the bridge, and you collect your men
in some bushes near the north abutment. You tell them
that when you give the word they are to charge with you
across the bridge at a run with bayonets fixed. There is
no sentry at the north end of the bridge, and the one at
the south end seems to be lazily looking into the field. You
give the signal and your patrol leaps out, but in the
middle of the bridge your whole party is caught by fire
from machine guns located near the wooden fence half
way between the word Texas and the bridge. All but two
of your men fall. You are hit in the leg, but are dragged
back off the bridge to a copse at the edge of the stream.
Waiting for further developments, but hearing nothing
more of the enemy except laughter at the other end of
the bridge, you have your men carry you further eastward
along the stream to a place of comparative safety in the
woods. You start writing your message twenty yards
south of the railroad crossing east of Stiner at seven
o’clock. You find that you will be unable to travel for
some time. After sending the message, you remain with
one man where you are, both of you concealing yourselves
as well as possible.</p>


<h3>MESSAGES FROM COMMANDERS</h3>

<p>4. On July 22, 1932, you are Colonel Algernon M.
Potts, commanding the 48th Infantry which is acting as
Advance Guard for the 20th Division. You have at a
quarter to one just pushed two battalions of the enemy’s
infantry toward Woodside School House. Your adjutant
counts on the ground over which they have fled forty-eight
of their dead and wounded. When you have taken up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
reorganized your line from Plainview through the cross-roads
at 666 to, and including, the farm house one mile
and a quarter directly east of A. Logan, Lieutenant Shelley,
adjutant of the first battalion, reports to you that
Major Jones’ command has captured twenty-two prisoners.
While you are talking, suddenly a heavy fire of
artillery comes from somewhere in the vicinity of 603 west
of Hunterstown. At the same time a message reaches
you from Sergeant Stearns, who has been out with a combat
patrol to the south, that a regiment of the enemy’s
cavalry was between Table Rock and Herman at half past
two, and that a civilian had telephoned that an infantry
regiment of the enemy was seen marching west through
Hunterstown at twenty minutes to twelve that morning.
You have no reenforcements at hand, but send your reserve
of one battalion to prolong the right of your line
to the bridge at Fidler, B-7. Your artillery seems to be
superior to the enemy’s and is holding down his fire which
is growing heavier. The adjutants of the 2d and 3d battalions
report that their commands have lost 12 dead, 17
wounded, and 24 missing during the previous engagement.
You feel that you will scarcely be able to hold out more
than an hour under the present circumstances, but decide
to make strenuous efforts to do more. You start to write
your message to the Division Commander at four o’clock
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>5. You are Major Mark Montclair in command of the
battalion which constituted the reserves in the preceding
problem. When you arrive in your designated position at
a quarter to five you are immediately charged by two
troops of cavalry which you drive off to the south by
superior fire. You send in pursuit one company and a
machine gun. By the number of loose horses you see
galloping about and by the haste with which the troopers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
took to their heels, you infer that the casualties must have
been large. Your adjutant arrives at this time reporting
that sixteen prisoners in sound condition have been taken,
that twelve dead and twenty-two wounded of the enemy
have been counted, and that your own losses are 3 missing,
4 dead, and 8 wounded. Just before you start to write
your message at a quarter to six, word reaches you from
A Company which is still pursuing the enemy, that they
have captured 18 prisoners and have killed and wounded
twelve. You finish your message at five minutes to six,
and then go over your lines in order to make them stronger
for defense.</p>

<p>6. On June 12, 1925, you are Captain James A. Marion
in command of Company I, 203d Infantry. Your company,
which constitutes a detached post from your regiment
acting as outpost at Granite Hill, is at 601, five
hundred yards west of Hunterstown Cross-roads. At
twenty-five minutes to five in the morning you are charged
by a squadron of cavalry from the J. Bell farm. They
strike you from the front, and you are holding them by
your fire when a troop hits your right flank riding at a
full gallop out of the woods from the direction of the
Henderson Meeting House. You are in a very awkward
position and are prepared to do or die, when, without
warning of any kind, a squadron of your own 29th Cavalry
which has been on a raiding expedition in the direction of
New Oxford, deploys at a gallop from Hunterstown. The
enemy, who is now in turn struck in flank, is in serious
straits. He breaks and runs in the direction of Table
Rock, the friendly squadron pursuing. You count 45 dead
and 62 wounded of the enemy. Of your own troops 12
infantrymen are missing, 3 cavalrymen and 9 infantrymen
dead, and 5 cavalrymen and 18 infantrymen wounded.
You start to write your message at twenty minutes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
six. You straighten out your former position and send
strong connecting and reconnoitering patrols to north
and west.</p>

<p>7. On May 13, 1922, you are Major Gerald Pendelton
of the 1st Battalion, 43d Infantry. You have been ordered
by your regimental commander to establish by a line of
your own troops a defensive position facing east from the
4 (exclusive) in 664 east of Hamilton, D-8, to the southeast
corner of the orchard (inclusive), five hundred yards
northwest of Stock Farm. At five minutes to ten at night
you have formed your line as ordered and are beginning
to entrench. You are proceeding with your work when a
messenger from B Company on the left flank tells you that
G Company of the 2d Battalion has arrived at the 4 in
664, and that at ten minutes to ten the right flank of that
company was beginning to dig. Seven minutes later another
messenger from A Company arrives with similar information
concerning Company E, 2d Battalion, 47th Infantry;
he states that the left flank of that company at
thirteen minutes to ten started to dig twenty yards south
of the corner of the orchard. You go over your lines
correcting positions here and there and start to send a
message at twenty-five minutes to eleven. The order of
your interior companies is, left to right, C, D.</p>

<span class="fs90">VERBAL FIELD MESSAGE</span></h2>

<h3>OBSERVATION—ATTENTION—EXPOSITION</h3>

<p>There are occasions when it becomes proper not to write
the field message, but to speak it. If the enemy is strong
and active, so that a bearer of information runs grave risk
of capture, the message is safer as a verbal one. In the
case of the written one, both message and messenger are
lost; in the case of the verbal one, only the messenger.
Therefore, it is best to entrust the information to the care
of the messenger’s mind. The facts deposited there should
remain in readiness for the first opportunity of delivery.</p>

<p>There are times, too, when no chance is offered to write
a message on account of the pressure of the enemy. The
attention of a leader may be so occupied with warding off,
or moving away from, strong hostile bodies, that work
with pencil and paper becomes an impossibility.</p>

<p>The form of the written field message must be abbreviated.
The gist of the <em>Heading</em> and <em>Ending</em> must be
stated by the messenger upon his arrival at his destination;
and the <em>Body</em> must be contracted into one or two
sentences depending upon the accuracy and intelligence of
the messenger. Where officers are messengers the message
may be lengthened. For our purpose and practice we
must attempt the shorter form.</p>

<p>The usual procedure in sending off a verbal message
may be represented by the following dialogue:</p>

<p>Patrol Leader (or Commander): “Swinton, go back at
once to the Commanding Officer of our Outpost and say,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>Twelve enemy’s cavalry marching north on Carlisle
Road at Hamilton 11:45 a. m. Repeat.”</p>

<p>Swinton: “I am going back to the Commanding Officer
of our Outpost and say,—</p>

<p>Twelve of enemy marching north on Carlisle Road at
11:45 a. m.”</p>

<p>P. L.: “No, Swinton, twelve enemy’s <em>cavalry</em> marching
north on Carlisle Road <em>at Hamilton</em> 11:45 a. m. Repeat
again.”</p>

<p>Swinton: “I am to go back right away and say to Commanding
Officer,—</p>

<p>Twelve enemy’s cavalry marching north on Carlisle
Road at Hamilton 11:45 a. m. Repeat.”</p>

<p>P. L.: “Not quite; you are to go back to Commanding
Officer of Outpost. Repeat again.”</p>

<p>Swinton: “I am to go back and say to Commanding
Officer of the Outpost,—</p>

<p>Twelve enemy’s cavalry marching north on Carlisle
Road at Hamilton at 11:45 a. m.”</p>

<p>P. L.: “That’s right. It is now 12 o’clock. Notice
where we are located. I am going to continue on my
mission toward the southwest. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Swinton: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>When Swinton arrives at headquarters he ought thus
to be able to give to his commanding officer not only the
accurate <em>Body</em> of the verbal message, but the contents of
the <em>Heading</em> and <em>Ending</em> of a similar written one.</p>

<p>The above conversation is not exaggerated. It is not
only what <em>does</em> happen, but what <em>should</em> happen. It does
happen because the average American has rarely developed
his powers of attention to things outside of his
interest. It should happen because every word in every
good message is a vital word. Any omission or substitution
is a loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>


<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>In each of the following problems try to condense the
essential facts, without loss of substance or truth, if possible,
into one sentence. The <em>Body</em> only will be attempted.
In other words, that part of the dialogue which preceded
the last speech of the Patrol Leader will be imitated. It is
presumed that we are now conversant with the material
of the <em>Heading</em> and <em>Ending</em>. We shall, therefore, dispense
with these parts of the message in the verbal exercise.</p>

<p><em>CAUTION.—Under no circumstances should there be
any writing done in connection with the solution of the
problems. A violation of this prohibition will destroy the
value of the exercise.</em></p>

<p>1. You are alone in your aeroplane scouting north from
your Division which is at Granite Hill. While you are
flying low in the vicinity of B-A, you notice a moving
cloud of dust which produces a dark spot on the road leading
south from Guernsey. The haze extends from the
lower edge of the “G” in Guernsey indistinctly through the
town. You turn off and fly over Center Mills. When you
return the head of the dust cloud has reached the first
road-fork south of Guernsey and the tail of it is at the
lower edge of the “G.” You land in twelve minutes at
Granite Hill. It is one o’clock in the afternoon. You are
so cold that you walk with difficulty. You call a Corporal
of the Signal Corps to you and give him a verbal message.</p>

<p>2. You are sitting on the knoll at 624 immediately
south of the “Sta.” in Granite Hill Station, 5-E. You see
about fifteen horsemen cross the railroad tracks and ride
up to the cross-roads to the east of you. It is half past
ten in the morning when you see them split up into three
parties, one riding southwest, one northeast, and one
southeast on the three different roads in your vicinity. As
the party on the road running southeast comes opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
you, they dismount. You can make them out to be
cavalrymen of the enemy. As they start in your rear to
cross the stream and to come toward you, you decide to
send a verbal message.</p>

<p>3. You are proceeding from the cross-roads southwest
of Plainview (B-5) toward Hershey Mill (B-6). When
you approach the mill race you notice a quantity of smoke
rising; when you come nearer you see the smouldering
ruins of the mill. You go on to the Miller’s house and
there perceive that the bridge has buckled in the middle
and is lying on its side in the water. The Miller tells you
that an aeroplane of the enemy went up and down the
Conewago at six o’clock the evening before, until it finally
landed a bomb upon the bridge. As it was circling to
leave, it let another bomb drop upon the mill. You go to
the Miller’s telephone and send a message.</p>

<p>4. You are lying on the long knoll 566, five hundred
yards south of C-6. You are watching at half past two
in the afternoon two infantrymen of the enemy who are
walking along the edge of the stream to the west. You
have been interested in their movements ever since they
crossed the first road to the southwest several moments ago.
While you are watching them, you are fired upon by what
you estimate to be sixteen rifles from the woods to the
south. You hasten north and give to one of your men a
verbal message on the way.</p>

<p>5. You are proceeding south along the stream at 7⅓-E.
At twenty minutes after eight in the morning you
approach the more densely wooded section of country near
the bridge. You look toward the cross-roads to the west
and spy in the field some of the enemy loafing and talking
at the letter “8” in 488. You see four stacks of arms and
are making further observations, when you hear a rustle of
undergrowth in the woods. Eight men rush out upon you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Three of your men are killed. You escape with one man.
As soon as you are able, you give him a verbal message,
and both of you take different routes back to headquarters.</p>

<p>6. You are reconnoitering south along the railroad
track from Biglerville. When you reach the siding at 626,
you notice that part of the track exactly opposite “B,”
both on the siding and main line, is completely blown
away. You count ten ties burning at the side of the road.
While you are making an inventory of the situation, you
are fired upon by a machine gun mounted on a flat car near
the next bridge to the south. The car apparently filled
with men seems to be approaching. Your patrol scatters
to the fields. You give one man a verbal message.</p>

<p>7. You have been sent with two men to find out whether
the Conewago is fordable at any point between Table Rock
and Fidler, B-7. After some search you find a crossing
directly south of the zero in the number 540 which marks
the contour of that height. Some time ago you sent a
written message to the effect that there was a picket
located at the Logan farm house. You have finished
searching thoroughly that part of the stream assigned to
you, when a strong party of the enemy is seen approaching
your position from A. Logan. You give your remaining
man a verbal message. Each takes a separate route.</p>

<p>8. You are in charge of a small reconnoitering patrol
going south from Boyd School House. As you approach
the marsh (7-4¼5, bottom) at the west of the road, you see
three pieces of artillery stuck in the mud up to their hubs.
You find that the guns are 3 in. field pieces. While you
are investigating their mechanism in order to confirm your
opinion that they belong to hostile troops, about forty
men of the enemy with ropes and tackle appear about 400
yards to the south. You hurry away under cover, and find
a telephone. You send a verbal message over the wire at
twenty minutes to five in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>9. You are delivering a message by motor cycle from
Center Mills to Granite Hill Station. You are riding at
about thirty miles an hour on a road supposedly clear of
the enemy, when you are met by a fusillade from the woods
in the vicinity of Henderson Meeting House. As you pass
the road-fork, shots follow you and you feel a sharp pain
in the calf of your leg. You speed up to pass the cross-roads
at Hunterstown, and in two minutes reach Granite
Hill Station. At twenty minutes after nine in the
morning you dismount from your motor cycle and direct
an infantryman standing near you to take a verbal
message to headquarters in addition to the written one you
hand him.</p>

<p>10. You are Captain Williams in command of Company
B, 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry. You are acting as a
support during the Outpost duty of your battalion. You
are at 592, northwest of the Good Intent School House,
D-7, and are engaged in driving back a company of
infantrymen which is attacking you from the stream to
the west. At twenty-five minutes to ten in the morning
you are suddenly attacked also by a platoon of infantry
from the direction of Herman. The nearest friendly
troops are those at battalion headquarters. You are in a
serious predicament. You at once send a verbal message
by an intelligent sergeant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have doubtless demonstrated to our own satisfaction
by means of the problems above how difficult it is to frame
a message briefly and unmistakably. It might be well to
inquire why we have had this trouble. An analysis may
not only reveal, but also remedy, the cause of our inability
to achieve the desired result.</p>

<p>We find upon investigation that we have permitted
certain practical talents to lie unused in our minds. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
have not acquired the habit of observing anything outside
of our desire, of listening to anything outside of our
interest, and of explaining anything outside of simplicity.
Strict observation, attention, and exposition are the
ordinary tools of a military man. Let him develop them to
the highest degree and he has done no more than is
expected of him.</p>

<p>Here, between the study of the field message, which
informs commanders, and the field order, which directs
troops, it is especially fitting for us to reckon with mental
improvement. For it is in this interval between the
information’s coming to, and the decision’s going from, a
leader that the fateful question arises, “What is my plan?”
His thoughts, before they arrive at a decision, must take
in and classify in a certain definite order all obtainable
and pertinent facts. He must assemble all his data before
he can take the slightest risk as to how his troops are to
act. Lives are at stake in the passing minutes; victory is
awaiting the decision. In all this stress and excitement
the commander must observe and listen as if he were
stalking a deer in a thicket. And when his mind is made
up he must formulate his decision as if he were sitting
before his own peaceful hearth writing a letter. But he
must do both in one per cent of the time allowed for
stalking deer or writing letters.</p>

<p>To acquire this ability, he must have regarded beforehand
the development of these three talents as a necessity.
If he has caused himself to be a faithful observer, so that
he is capable of taking in many details at once, if he has
compelled himself to be a keen listener so that he can
absorb every word instantly, if he has made himself into a
skilful instructor so that he can express rapidly his exact
wishes and knowledge, he will be able, when the crisis
comes, to give his entire attention to his plan. Otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
he will be hampered. If he has not observed, if he has not
listened, he will be able neither to decide nor to state his
will forcibly.</p>

<p>The following hints may show us our deficiencies:</p>

<p>1. In regard to the scope and habit of observation,—</p>

<p>(a) Look out of the window, count off to yourself five
seconds, turn about and see how much of the view or of its
salient features you can describe.</p>

<p>(b) After you have taken your next long walk through
the woods or open country, go over in your mind your
journey. Pick out points along the course and see
whether you know in regard to each: (1) the appearance
and number of trees within your view, (2) the rise and fall
of the ground within your view, (3) or the direction you
next took.</p>

<p>(c) What is the exact color of the hair or eyes, or
the shape of the hands of your closest associates?</p>

<p>(d) Have someone place five articles on a plane surface
while your back is turned. Look at the objects for ten
seconds; then look away and describe fully their appearance
and position.</p>

<p>2. In regard to the power and habit of listening,—</p>

<p>(a) Have someone read aloud to you three sentences
capable of being understood by a person of ordinary intellect.
Try to repeat in your own words every idea given in
the reading.</p>

<p>This is not a memory exercise.</p>

<p>(b) The next time you find yourself interrupting someone,
check yourself at once, and try to repeat in your own
mind the substance of what the speaker has last uttered.</p>

<p>(c) The next time you find yourself a part of an
audience to which a sermon or lecture is being delivered,
say to yourself, “I am going to get at least for practice’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
sake every idea this speaker has to offer.” Then note how
short a time it is before you miss a phrase.</p>

<p>3. In regard to the power of exposition,—</p>

<p>(a) With your hands behind your back, try to describe
in a sentence each one of the following articles:</p>

<p>A barrel, a scabbard, a tea kettle, a potato, a billiard
cue, a chrysanthemum, a dumb-bell, your shoes, a fox
terrier, a grand piano.</p>

<p>(b) Give the shortest complete description you can of
the parts and working of a rifle.</p>

<span class="fs90">THE FIELD ORDER, THE ESTIMATE,
THE DECISION, THE EXPRESSION</span></h2>


<p>“Upon the information of the enemy and of the terrain
obtained by reconnaissance, and, as far as time will permit,
upon the study of the terrain made by the leader in the
field of probable operations, the plan of action is based.”
So state our Field Service Regulations.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Decision, then,
is built upon the amount of material that the observation
and attention of a commander can collect. And it is only
<em>his</em> observation and attention which count. It is only
what he himself has fixed in his own mind which is going
to do the troops harm or good. He may receive dozens of
excellent messages, or may view the battle-field for twenty
miles; yet it is only what he himself appropriates to his
own straight thinking, which can influence the outcome.
The reports or the visions of others cannot enter into the
decision, unless he has transferred those reports or visions
to his own calculations. How can he weigh what he has
not handled—consider what he has not absorbed? <em>The decision
of a leader issues from the door of his own observation
and attention.</em> The most pertinent facts may be laid
at that threshold only to be shut out because he has not
increased his capacity to take them in. And no one else
can enter there in order to do the work for him unless the
intruder becomes virtually, if not actually, the leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>


<h3>THE ESTIMATE</h3>

<p>Let us suppose that the observation and attention have
taken in all that they should. These various items lying
in a more or less jumbled mass must now be sorted. Information
of one class must not be found mixed with that
of another class. Each organized body of information
must approach the leader’s judgment by itself so that:
(1) nothing will be overlooked; so that (2) each item will
be with its proper set. After they have all passed through
his thought, certain ones, of course, may be discarded; but
they all must none the less be first reviewed consciously by
the leader. This process is called the <em>estimate of the
situation</em>. In order, therefore, to comply with the full
conditions of such an estimate, a fixed classification of all
the essentials which should go through the hopper of a
leader’s judgment has been made. After his information
has been obtained and before his decision has been formed,
the leader must say to himself:—</p>

<p>1. What is my mission?</p>

<p>2. What are the forces—the enemy’s and my own?</p>

<p>3. What conditions are favorable and what unfavorable?</p>

<p>4. What is the enemy doing and what will he probably
do?</p>

<p>5. What effect has the terrain upon my mission?</p>

<p>6. What different courses are open to me in order to
carry out my mission, and what are the advantages and
disadvantages of each?</p>

<p>The method just described is no more than that of
collecting, classifying, and weighing data. It is the very
process we must follow before we can write a decent theme,
article, report, or anything fit to read. An estimate of a
situation is nothing more than an outline of observations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
made in order to arrive at a proper conclusion. The
leader has no time to write down the points. But he nevertheless
assembles in his own mind everything which bears
on his subject—unity; he classifies all this into groups
with a certain orderly arrangement—coherence; and he
considers the effect of each item upon his mission and
situation—clear thinking.</p>


<h3>THE DECISION</h3>

<p>As soon as he has finished with this estimate of the situation,
there should stand forth as a result of this clear
thinking his decision. If he has been in the habit of making
his ideas unmistakable in conversation or writing—if
he has been accustomed to dealing in good exposition, his
plan ought to be clear and simple. For no man can make
clear statements without first thinking clear thoughts. If
then he has habitually insisted upon his own use of only
the clearest phraseology, he ought certainly to arrive at
a clear plan whatever may be its tactical value.</p>


<h3>THE EXPRESSION</h3>

<p>To give this plan expression is the purpose of the field
order. Certainly if the decision is clear and simple, the
translation into language ought to be easy. Infantry
Drill Regulations state: “Ambiguity or vagueness indicates
either vacillation or inability to formulate orders.”
Since vacillation is a matter of character, the discussion
of such a trait is outside of this course; but the inability
to formulate orders is not. In fact it belongs only in the
course of Rhetoric or English. The following terms are
found in our Regulations and Text Books: “Clear and concise
instructions are given as to the action to be taken in
combat”;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “an order must be definite and the expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of a fixed decision”;<a id="FNanchor_5a" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “field orders are brief”;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “field orders
must be brief and definite”;<a id="FNanchor_6a" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “clear and decisive orders
are the logical result of definite and sure decisions and are
the means of transforming the decision into action”;<a id="FNanchor_6b" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
“Make your order short and make it definite”;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “above all
do not give vague orders”;<a id="FNanchor_7a" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “be positive and definite”;<a id="FNanchor_7b" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “a
plan, promising success, may fail if it does not find correct
expression in an order.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And so our manuals keep on
telling us to use correct English, but failing to tell us how.
Putting the clarified decision into the form of an order is
the business of Rhetoric. And the process requires the
application of every rule for correct English we have
learned or are going to learn.</p>

<p>“<em>Often a faulty expression, a word too much or too
little, or an omission, may become the source of serious
consequences</em>,” declares Buddecke. Even in the orders of
the greatest commanders, a twist of phrase or a wrong
word has given an unintentional meaning, so that troops
have from the very construction of the order acted contrary
to the will of the chief. Napoleon, in a despatch to
Davout before the battles of Auerstadt and Jena, stated:
“If the Prince of Portecorvo (Bernadotte) is with you,
you may march together; but the Emperor hopes that he
will be already in the position assigned him at Dornberg.”
Bernadotte, as it happened, had not gone to Dornberg.
He was with Davout. He determined, from the last clause
of the order and from the word “may,” that Napoleon
desired him to be at Dornberg. To Dornberg he marched,
and there he calmly waited within sound of the guns, while
the battles of Auerstadt and Jena were fought. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
useless both to Napoleon and to Davout. Indeed, he was
seriously needed by Davout who, with 27,000 was opposed
to 51,000 Prussians. Yet the error is attributable not to
Bernadotte but to Napoleon, who meant to say, “You
should march together; but the Emperor hopes that he
has arrived,” etc. Napoleon for once did not say what he
meant. It is likely we may be found more wanting in this
regard.</p>

<p>There is no error in the expressiveness of a field order
which the analytical and synthetical study of English will
not overcome. We must first learn by analysis to recognize
mistakes when we see them. We must then try to
manipulate our language so that those mistakes will not
occur. Indeed, we must go further than the mere negative
avoidance of mistakes. We must not be satisfied until we
have made our expressions exert a positive force. The
ways and means of so doing are found in the simple rules of
rhetoric.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not too much to say that the American
works against heavier odds than the European. The
syntax of the inflected languages of Europe demands that
the speaker pay a proper attention to the changes of
number, gender, and case, if he would not appear ridiculous,
whereas the English language, being almost without
inflections, permits its speaker to toss his words about with
an ease unknown to Continental speech, and still be intelligible.
The result is that the European is trained to more
care, and, therefore, greater exactness, than is demanded
of the American. Moreover, the average American’s commercial
education does not include a careful, analytical
study of an inflected language. His geographical aloofness
from the rest of the world insures him also a linguistic
isolation. The European, on the other hand, has an added
advantage in that by traversing a territory no larger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
than three or four of our big states, he will encounter a
half-dozen languages, of all of which he must have some
knowledge if he is to be a financial success.</p>

<p>The American, then, in writing orders is competing
against a handicap. Von Kiessing, a foreigner, states
that “the best of plans, the most skilful combinations,
may fail, if the commander or his staff officers cannot express
them properly”; and Buddecke, also a foreigner,
insists that “a plan, promising success, may fail if it does
not find correct expression in an order.” If these men,
schooled in language as well as in tactics, find admonition
so emphatically necessary, how must we look upon the
matter?</p>

<p>The form and composition of the order, if practiced
now, ought to give us a certain amount of independence
when we come to practical and strategical considerations
later. For certainly, we shall be far ahead of our fellows
who must try at once, and for the first time, both tactics
and composition.</p>


<h3>THE FORM OF THE FIELD ORDER</h3>

<p>“To enable the will of the commander to be quickly
understood, to secure prompt cooperation among his subordinates,
and for ready reference, field orders are required
to follow a general form. This form divides an
order into sections or parts and assigns to each a particular
class of information.</p>

<p>The parts of the field order are:</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">
<span class="smcap">The Heading.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Distribution of Troops</span> (in certain orders).<br>
<span class="smcap">The Body.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Ending.</span>”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>The only difference between the divisions of the field
message and the field order, then, is that the latter contains
in certain orders <em>The Distribution of Troops</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heading.</span>—The heading contains:</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">
<span class="smcap">The Title or Name of Issuing Officer’s Command.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Place.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Date.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Hour of Issue.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Number of the Order.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">The Reference to Map Used.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The <em>Title</em> or <em>Name</em> corresponds to the <em>Name</em> of Sending
Detachment in the field message. But a title is the name
applied to the temporary duty of a command, such as,
“Advance Guard, Det. 21st Div.,” whereas the name itself
might be “162d Inf., Det. 21st Div.” <em>The Place</em> does not
need to be given so specifically as in the field message, because
the command issuing a field order takes up much
more space than a reconnaissance party. The <em>Date</em> and
<em>Hour of Issue</em> are written as in the field message. Field
Orders are numbered in sequence usually annually. The
<em>Reference</em> to <em>Map Used</em> is placed immediately below the
number. The Heading of a field order would appear thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Field Orders: <span class="pad30pc">Det. 21st Div., 12th Corps,</span><br>
No. 22 <span class="pad50pc">Leavenworth, Kansas,</span><br>
(Geological Survey Sheet)</p>
<p class="rt">9 Dec. 28, 8-15 p. m.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Distribution of Troops.</span>—“The distribution of
troops shows the tactical components into which a command
is divided (advance guard, main body, etc.) and the
troops assigned to each. It is generally used in march
orders and in the first field order applying to a command
newly created or organized. In other cases it is usually
more convenient to name the troops in the body of the
order, where their duties are prescribed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>When a ‘distribution’ is used, it is headed ‘Troops,’ and
in written or printed orders is placed on the left of <em>The
Body</em>, occupying about one-third of the page. The tactical
components are marked with lettered subheads (a),
(b), etc., the troops listed under each performing the
task prescribed in the similarly marked paragraph of the
body of the order.</p>

<p>When orders are dictated or sent by wire or signals,
the distribution of troops (if used) is given immediately
after paragraph 2, without number.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In orders for a
regiment and smaller bodies the <em>Distribution</em> of <em>Troops</em>
is usually omitted.</p>

<p>The Distribution of Troops in a field order would appear
thus:</p>

<div class="fs90">
<p>&#160;&#160; <em>Troops.</em><br>
(a) Independent Cavalry:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Col. Adams.</span><br>

(c) Main Body, in order of march:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">1st Bn, 2d Inf.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">1st Bn, 5th F. A.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Co. A, Engrs. (less det.).</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Amb. Co. No. 1 (less det.).</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">1st F. Hosp.</span><br>
(d) Signal Troops:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lieut. Dash.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">1 plat., Co. A.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Body.</span>—The Body, of course, is the main part of
the order. It contains the information and instructions
for the command. It is to this part that Buddecke refers
when he says: “<em>The order, which is to transform decision
into action, is of the utmost importance.</em>”</p>


<p>The Sentence and the Paragraph, then, should be perfectly
constructed. Each one of those elements should be
tested to see that it is unified, coherent, and emphatic.
<em>The examples herein given, or any set phrasing, should
never be imitated.</em> Every leader must compose his own
words, his own decision. He must give to his subordinates
the language that best suits the particular occasion.
Otherwise there will be no unity of structure and little likelihood
of unity of action. Every military situation is a
a law unto itself, and the language of the field order should
fit that law.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there are certain aids, as we shall see, in
composing <em>the Body</em>. The topic of each paragraph is to
be found in our Regulations. We must see that nothing
enters the paragraph or sub-paragraph but that which belongs
in the topic assigned. We must see, also, that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of the matter belonging in a paragraph is placed there,
and that every sentence in the paragraph is free from
violations of Unity, Coherence, and Emphasis.</p>

<p>“Paragraph 1 contains such information of the enemy
and of our supporting troops as it is desirable that subordinates
should know.”</p>

<p>“Paragraph 2 contains the general plan of the commander,
or so much thereof as will insure cooperation of
all parts of the command.”</p>

<p>“Paragraph 3 contains the detailed tactical dispositions
adopted by the commander to carry out the plan outlined
in paragraph 2, including the tasks assigned to each of
the several combatant fractions of the command. These
tasks are given under lettered subheads (a), (b), etc., the
leading fraction, or the one having the most important
duty to perform, being generally considered first. For instance:
In an attack order it is customary to consider the
artillery first; in a march order troops are considered
according to their position in column.”</p>

<p>“Instructions applicable to all of these fractions may be
embodied in a sub-paragraph, letter (X), at the end of
paragraph 3.”</p>

<p>“Paragraph 4 contains instructions for the trains, and
may designate the position of ammunition distributing
stations, dressing stations, and stations for slightly
wounded.”</p>

<p>“The last paragraph, usually paragraph 5, shows where
the commander can be found or messages may be sent. In
orders of subordinate commanders, this paragraph also
gives the location of lines of information, if any have been
established.”</p>

<p>“If additional paragraphs are necessary, they are incorporated,
properly numbered, after paragraph 4.
Sometimes it is unnecessary to include instructions for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
trains; but whatever the number of paragraphs the last
always shows where the commander can be found, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Briefly, then, the paragraphs may be epitomized as
follows:</p>

<p class="negin4">1. Enemy (sub-paragraph neither numbered nor lettered).</p>

<p class="negin4">&#160; &#160; Your own troops (sub-paragraph neither numbered nor lettered).</p>

<p class="negin4">2. Plan (single paragraph).</p>

<p class="negin4">3. (a) Task of the leading, or the most important,
fraction of command.</p>

<p class="negin4">&#160;&#160; (b) Task of next, or next important, fraction of
command. (X) Anything which applies to all fractions of command.</p>

<p class="negin4">4. Trains.</p>

<p class="negin4">5. Location of commander or place to which messages
are to be sent (sub-paragraph neither numbered nor lettered).</p>

<p class="negin4">&#160; &#160; Location of lines of information (sub-paragraph
neither numbered nor lettered).</p>


<p>The Body of a field order would appear thus:</p>

<div class="p1 fs90 pad50pc">

<p class="p1">There are certain<br>
<span class="smcap pad30pc">Special Cautions</span><br>
in regard to the writing of the field order.</p>

<p>1.—What is required in paragraph 3 of the <em>Body</em> is
that the order be logical—coherent.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>2.—An order tells a subordinate <em>what</em> to do but not
<em>how</em> to do it.</p>

<p>3.—Conjectures, expectations, reasons for measures
adopted, and detailed instructions for a variety of possible
events, do not inspire confidence, and should be avoided.</p>

<p>4.—As a rule, an affirmative form of expression is used.
Such an order as: “The supply train will not accompany
the division,” is defective, because the gist of the order
depends upon the single word “not.” It is far better to
say, “The supply train will remain at so-and-so until
further orders.”</p>

<p>5.—Do not use such expressions as “attempt to capture,”
“try to hold,” “as far as possible,” “as well as you
can.” Besides being indefinite, they divide responsibility.
You, for example, receive an order “to try to capture” a
certain position. Immediately there pops into your mind
the suspicion that the commanding officer did not believe
that the place could be taken, or was not anxious about
having it captured. The commanding officer by the very
wording of his order has taken on himself a part of the
responsibility in the event of a repulse. At least he has
not placed all the burden of the undertaking upon you.
In the latter case he has been guilty of improper subordination.</p>

<span class="fs90">PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD ORDER</span></h2>


<p>After the plan of Trench of the English Service, we are
going to take up the problems in the construction of the
field order along the lines on which tactical situations
naturally develop themselves during hostilities. We shall
discover that the sequence will not only conform to
actual conditions, but will lead from the more simple to
the more complex. We shall, then, proceed with,—</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">
(1) The March Order.<br>
(2) The Attack Order.<br>
(3) The Order for Position in Readiness.<br>
(4) The Defense Order.<br>
(5) The Retreat Order.<br>
(6) The Pursuit Order.<br>
(7) The Halt Order.<br>
(8) The Outpost Order.<br>
</p>

<p>Emphasis will be laid upon the march and attack
orders, because they are the most usual and the most
critical.</p>

<p>In these problems all necessary data will be given. No
attempt will be made to mislead in regard to fact. But
every attempt will be made to mislead in regard to the expression
of the fact. Crude violations and mixtures of
rhetoric will therefore be found throughout.</p>

<p>In arranging his material the student should use his
own style and should not attempt to copy phraseology
from any military forms. <em>That which is most brief and
most unmistakable is best, no matter who writes the order.</em></p>

<p><em>Note.</em>—The topographical data will not be found upon
the map. The units for which a field order must be written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
require an area larger than that which our limited sheet
provides. The student, by reading over the problem two
or three times ought, with the aid of his imagination, to
perceive the will of the commander.</p>


<h3>(1) <span class="smcap">March Orders</span></h3>

<p>1.—On June 12, 1925, you are Major General Abercrombie
in command of the 16th Division of the 12th
Army Corps. You wish your division, which is in the
vicinity of Bruceville, to march over to Littlestown the
next day. You want it to cover the base and line of
supply for your troops. You want it to do all this because
one of your flying corps lieutenants saw from a captive
balloon about a division of the enemy pass through
Chambersburg early in the morning. The enemy was
marching east and according to the lieutenant was composed
of infantry, cavalry, field artillery—in fact, all
branches of the service. You finish with this your twenty-second
order since January 1st at a quarter after ten at
night. But just before you finish with your order a
Colonel of Cavalry on your staff tells you that he personally
saw cavalry in Gettysburg during the evening. You
want your advance guard, which consists of the 1st Brigade,
1st Battalion of the 1st Field Artillery, Company A,
First Battalion of Engineers, one section of a Signal Company,
and the first ambulance company, to get past the
bridge over Pipe Creek at precisely six o’clock and to go
along the main road to Littlestown in its route. The
advance guard is to be commanded by Brigadier General
Black. Now the main body, you figure, will go along in
column from front to rear,—one section of the Signal
Company, the fourth regiment of Infantry, the Field
Artillery Brigade without its combat train, the 2d Brigade
without the 4th Infantry, the third Brigade, the Signal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Company (Company A) without its detachments, the first
Battalion of Engineers without Company A, the Field
Artillery Combat Train, and then the second, third, and
fourth Ambulance companies.</p>

<p>You want this main body to start across the Pipe Creek
bridge at half past six and you want it to go along keeping
a distance of a mile behind the tail of the advance
guard. You want to tell your troops, too, that you will
be with the tail of the reserve of the advance guard. You
intend to sign your order yourself and you want copies
sent to Lieutenants Kingsley and Lawrence, and to
Brigade Generals Black, Dare, Evans, Colonel File, Major
Glad, Captain Hume and your staff. You want your
trains to follow your main body in order from front to
rear: field trains, ammunition columns, supply columns,
field hospitals, medical reserve, and pack train. You feel
that the man in command of your signal corps should
arrange to have radio connection between your independent
cavalry and the advance guard. That idea brings
up another matter. Your independent cavalry, which will
be commanded by Colonel File and which will consist of the
1st Cavalry and one section of the Signal Company, will
have to reconnoiter all the roads which lead out of Gettysburg
and which are between the York Pike and the Emmitsburg
road. You want the cavalry to reconnoiter the
York Pike and the Emmitsburg road, too. You want this
cavalry to maneuver so that they will come in contact
with the enemy as soon as practicable. Now you want
the independent cavalry to do all this because you want it
to cover the whole movement of your troops and you think
it ought to start out promptly at five o’clock in the
morning in order to accomplish its purpose best.</p>

<p>2.—On the tenth of August, 1928, you are Colonel
Bruce commanding the 129th regiment of Infantry which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
is acting as advance guard to the 5th Division. On the
tenth of August at half past five in the morning at the
Penitentiary of Leavenworth, Kansas, you sign your 27th
field order. You have in reality dictated it to your
officers, but you sign it as soon as you have finished. You
have told them in substance that all but one squad of
Troop A, under command of Captain Briggs, 21st
Cavalry, would comprise the Advance Cavalry; that the
first battalion of the 1st Infantry, one squad of Troop A,
21st Cavalry, and a detachment of Company A of the
Engineers under Major Chittombly, would constitute the
support; and that the Reserve would be Headquarters and
2d Battalion of the 129th Infantry, Battery B of the 5th
Field Artillery, the third Battalion of the 129th Infantry,
and a Detachment of Ambulance Company, Number 1.
You assembled all the officers of your command when you
dictated your order and you told them that the troops of
the command would march in order as stated above. You
told them that you would stay with the reserve and would
march near its head. You stated that the field train would
assemble at the first cross-roads to the south and there
wait under command of Captain Phillips, the Quartermaster
of the 1st Infantry, for the field train of the main
body and would join that field train as it passed. The
main body was to come along so that the head of it would
be just a half mile behind the tail of the Reserve of the
Advance Guard. The whole of the Advance Guard you
want to march on Kickapoo, because the enemy which
someone had reported to have camped near Atchison the
night before, and is composed of all branches of the
service, has cavalry patrols out which were seen in the
vicinity of Kickapoo yesterday. You wish the point of
the support to begin the march at a quarter to six in the
morning. It is to go by the general route which marks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the turning points Atchison Cross, Frenchman, Kickapoo,
along a continuous stretch of road. So that the Advance
Cavalry will have time to get ahead, you want it to leave
camp at once and march by way of Atchison Cross to
Kickapoo. This proceeding is necessary because you want
all the country west of the line of march to the extent of
three miles very carefully observed. You want Sheridan’s
Drive to be observed carefully also. You want the reserve
to follow the support so that there will be 800 yards
distance between it and the tail of the support. You send
a copy of the order to your Division Commander.</p>

<p>3.—On the thirty-first of May, 1931, you are Major
General Perkins in command of the 16th Division, 22d
Corps. War has just broken out and not any of your
army has crossed the frontier as yet. However, it is going
to do so on the next day, and the 22d Corps is going to
march on Thurmont and Frederick. Your division has
been ordered to cover the left of the whole army. Your
independent cavalry in command of Colonel Frank and
composed of the 11th Cavalry and the first radio section of
the Signal Corps, is to be followed by the Advance Guard
under command of Brigadier General Blood. The advance
guard is composed of the first Brigade, the first battalion
of the first field artillery, a company of the first Battalion
of Engineers, the first Ambulance Company, and one radio
section of the Signal Company. You sign your order at
eight in the evening and send copies to Brigadier Generals
Blood, Cook, Dean, Enfield, Colonel Frank, Major Good,
Captain Harry, by officers. You also furnish copies to
your staff. You decide to have your division march on
Gettysburg in order to carry out your mission. Your
main body is going to start at seven in the morning and
will march in the following order: one section of the Signal
Company, the first battalion of the 4th Infantry, all but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
one battalion of the first brigade of Field Artillery, all of
the second Brigade but the first battalion of the 4th
Infantry, the entire third Brigade, all but one company of
the first battalion of engineers, Signal Company A without
certain detachments mentioned before, the field artillery
combat trains, and three ambulance companies. You want
the advance guard to be up and out of camp at half past
six in the morning. It is to march by the Chambersburg
Pike on Gettysburg and to be followed by the main body
with a mile between the two units. The independent
cavalry is to be up and out of camp by six o’clock in the
morning. You want your trains to follow your main body
five miles behind it and you want them to follow in this
order: field trains, first section of the supply trains,
ammunition column, the remainder of the supply trains,
field hospitals, medical reserve, pack train. You want
your independent cavalry to advance on Gettysburg. You
want your independent cavalry to reconnoiter all the roads
which run out of Gettysburg to the south and east and you
want them to get in touch with the cavalry of the corps as
soon as possible. You are going to march at the forward
end of the reserve of the advance guard. When you have
signed your order at Chambersburg where your troops are
located, you have it telegraphed to Corps headquarters.</p>

<p>4.—On May the eleventh, 1940, you are in command of
the 8th Division of the 19th Corps. You are at Frederick,
Maryland, and you want your division to advance toward
Gettysburg and to be a protection to your main army
which is going to come through the passes of the mountains
in that vicinity. You are going to remain in Frederick
until half past eight the next morning, and then you are
going to go and be with the advance guard at its head.
You want your main body to begin to move out when the
head is at the first railroad crossing north of the town, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
at ten minutes to seven to follow a mile behind the advance
guard which you are going to have march along the Emmitsburg
Turnpike. The end of the column ought to be
across the first railroad crossing north of the town at half
past six in the morning. The enemy’s main army is near
Baltimore and Washington. <ins class="corr" id="tn-79" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'You haev heard'">
You have heard</ins> from pretty
good sources that a part of his army is in such a condition
that any immediate movement is rendered out of the question,
though you have reliable word that one of his divisions
and possibly more are in fit condition to move toward
the frontier. Indeed they may have done so, for already
your frontier is being observed by all sorts and kinds
of small detachments of the enemy. You want your field
trains to come along and get together north of the town
as soon as all of the troops have got out. You want them
to be divided into two sections and you want the first section
to be about two miles in rear of the troops and the
second section to come along after the first section with a
two mile distance. Your main body in order of march will
be, one section of the signal company, the first battalion of
the fourth regiment of infantry, the first brigade of Field
Artillery without its first battalion, all but the first
battalion of the second brigade, all but one company of the
first battalion of Engineers, Signal Company A without
its detachment, the field artillery combat train, and three
ambulance companies. You want the river crossings of
the Monocacy and the roads, railroads, and in fact all
approaches to them from the east to be especially observed
by the Advance Guard. That body will consist of the first
brigade, the first battalion of the first field artillery,
Company A of the Engineers, the first Ambulance
Company and the first section of the Signal Company, all
under command of Brigadier General Bates. The first
section of the field train will have the following order:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
field trains; one section of the supply column; one wagon
company of artillery ammunition; and one wagon
company of small arms ammunition. The second section:
field hospitals, all but two wagon companies of the
ammunition column; all but one section of the supply
column; medical reserve; and pack trains. You are going
to begin this whole march on the next day. Your
independent cavalry, commanded by Colonel Fine, and
consisting of the first regiment of Cavalry and one section
of the Signal Company is to start out at half past five in
the morning and cover your whole movement. You want
this cavalry to scout around Taneytown and see what it
can find on the roads which go off from the southeast from
there. The whole army of which you are a part aims to
take up an advance movement and it plans to get to
Gettysburg on the eighteenth of May. This is the second
field order you have issued in this campaign. You send
copies of it by your aide Lieut. Kill to Generals Bates,
Cutts, Dent, and Eaton; by Lieut. Link to Colonel Fine,
Major Good, Captain Hall, and to the commander of the
trains. You read the order to your staff, send a copy by
mail to Corps Headquarters and telegraph a synopsis to
the same place. You sign your order at a quarter after
nine.</p>

<p>5.—On June 10, 1925, you are Brigadier General
Stewart in command of a Detachment from the ninth
division. You are lost. You can find out nothing about
the enemy. Indeed you can get no wind of where your own
troops are. You assemble all your officers and read at ten
minutes after five in the morning an order which you have
written at Bonnyville where you are located. You want
your whole command to go by way of Whitehall and move
toward Levere. You want your field train and
ammunition wagon companies, on account of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
ignorance of the enemy to park near the western end of the
town where the road runs out. They are to make this
maneuver after half past six and are to be in readiness to
move to the west or to the east. The advance guard under
command of Colonel Dent, and composed of all of the
second infantry but the third battalion, is to march on the
road past St. Luke’s Church and then on the same road
toward Whitehall. It is to get past the road fork where
the main road goes out of the town at the southeastern
edge at twenty minutes to six. You are going to be with
the advance guard. You will be up front with the reserve.
Your independent cavalry is to march at half past four.
It consists of the first squadron of the fifth cavalry under
command of Major Curt. It is going to try to get in
touch with the enemy. The main body is to come along
after the advance guard so that it will be eight hundred
yards from the tail of it. Your main body will march in
the following order: third battalion of the second infantry,
first battalion without the reserve, the third regiment of
infantry, the first regiment of infantry, the artillery
reserve, the first ambulance company and Signal Company
A. Part of your main body is doing outpost duty, and
you have told your officer when you issued your order that
when the support of the advance guard reached St. Luke’s
Church the next morning the outpost would stand relieved,
and that it would take its place in column after it had
closed in to the road, when the troops came along.</p>


<h3>(2) <span class="smcap">Attack Orders</span></h3>

<p>6.—You are Brigadier General Greene commanding a
Detachment of the 18th Division, and on June 11, 1965,
you are at the headquarters of your division at St. Luke’s
Church. You receive reliable messages to the effect that
the enemy is in your front about two and a half miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
away. You determine to attack the left of the enemy and
to envelop that flank. You want the cavalry to cover
your own left flank, and you want the cavalry also to
send out patrols to keep a lookout on the right. First of
all, though, you want the battalion of artillery to go
south via the Newman farm and take a position north of
the farm. You want the artillery to begin firing as soon as
it arrives in the position designated. You have heard
from other patrols coming in that the enemy is taking up
a position on a hill in your front about the distance away
you had previously estimated. You want the first infantry
to form the reserve and you want it to follow in rear of
the left flank of the third infantry. The third infantry
will take up and follow over the same route as the artillery.
After crossing Plum Creek the whole regiment will move
to attack the enemy. The regiment will keep its left near
the road which runs past Piper and Whitehall. The
battalion of artillery when it is moving to its new position
should move off the road whenever it is necessary to screen
itself from hostile view. The second infantry will attack
along the road it is now on. It should not, however,
advance beyond the Whitehall School House until the
artillery opens fire. It ought then to help along the attack
in support of the third infantry. You sign your message
at half past six in the morning. You want your first
ambulance company to follow the reserve. When the company
gets to Plum Creek, however, it should stop there
and wait until further orders. You hear that your cavalry
out in front has defeated the enemy’s cavalry and that the
enemy’s cavalry is fleeing eastward. You wish to incorporate
this fact in your order. You will have some
one always ready to receive messages at the cross-roads at
the Newman farm if you are not there yourself. You
send a copy of this your sixth field order of the campaign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
by Lieutenant Cost to Major Call. You read the
order at half past six to your commanders of infantry
regiments, artillery battalion, signal company, and staff
officers. You desire the Signal Company to establish a
line which will connect you with Bonnyville, and you
should have a line to your support commander, who is the
commanding officer of the second infantry.</p>

<p>7.—You, on September 1, 1922, are at Kolpatrick
School House. You are in command of the 28th Brigade
3d Division, and you issue to your assembled officers by
word of mouth the twenty-ninth field order of this campaign
at ten minutes after nine in the morning. You send
a copy to the Chief of Staff of your Division by an aide.
You have just decided to attack a hostile detachment
which has just been reported by an officer to be near you
and to be about half your strength. In fact this detachment
has taken a position on a ridge of long mountains
about two and one-half miles straight to the south of you.
You wish to communicate to your troops, also, that the
entire army of which your brigade is a part is engaged in
a fight with the enemy; and that the right of the line of
the army is near Two Taverns. You do not want the
field train to move out and to accompany you in your
movement. The third infantry you have decided to make
your reserve. It ought to take up some kind of position
to the right of the second infantry and in rear of it. The
first infantry should move out and should follow the road
leading south, and before any of the others of the troops
it ought to attack the enemy in front. You want the first
infantry to begin their movement right off and then later
on to support the enveloping attack. The enveloping
attack you have trusted to the second and third infantry
regiments. The second followed by the third is to move
out with the artillery on their left. The whole body is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
march along Brush Run under cover of a ridge of mountains
on which you are located until it comes opposite to
the Brush Run School House. The artillery, as you plan
it, is then to go into position west of Brush Run School
House, and to open fire on the enemy. The second infantry
is then to deploy, and it is to deploy so that its
right will be about five hundred yards to the left of the
artillery’s position. The second infantry is then to go
right off into an attack on the enemy’s right flank. While
this body of troops is on the march (the second, and third
infantries and the artillery), the commanding officer of
the second infantry should see that the necessary precautions
are taken against surprise or attack by the enemy.
You have decided to be during the attack at the head of
the column on the extreme left until it deploys. After
that you are going to be with the reserve. The first
squadron of the fourth cavalry under your command is
going to cover your left in this movement. It should send
out strong patrols to the right besides sending them to
the left and get in touch with the right of the main army.
The ambulance will go along with the third infantry. But
when the third Infantry gets to Cedar Ridge, the ambulance
company will not proceed any further.</p>

<p>8.—On the 6th of January, 1930, you are Brigadier
General Hitt in command of the first Brigade, first Division.
You are at Ode, Missouri. You defeated the
enemy the day before. You have since heard that he is
occupying the line which extends from Baldwin to the hill
south of Eppley’s Farm. You have an advance guard for
your Brigade and you decide to take up an attack formation
which will not necessitate the use of an advance guard
any longer. The trains you feel should not be moved from
where they are located, but the ambulance company ought
to move toward, and take a suitable position near, Ode.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
You decide to attack immediately, and you are going to
do so in a way which will cause the enemy’s left to be enveloped.
You issue the 61st field order of the campaign at
half past nine in the morning.</p>

<p>You understand from reliable sources, in fact from
officers’ patrols, that there is a large convoy of the enemy
parked somewhere in Farley. You decide that the first
infantry ought to take up the main advance against the
enemy, and you think it ought to go in a general direction
along the road which runs past Square Corners and Eppley.
After the 1st Infantry has launched its attack it
ought to support the attack of the 2d Infantry. The 3d
Infantry is going to send the 2d Infantry a machine gun
company, which you think you will have attached to the
2d Infantry. The 2d Infantry, you have figured out,
ought to advance, keeping the ravine near Meas between
itself and the enemy. After it strikes the ravine, it ought
to go along it until the first part of the column approaches
and comes up to a point where the ravine starts to bend
south. When it has exactly reached that point where the
ravine does bend south, it ought to start out on the
enemy’s left in an attack. The 2d Infantry ought to push
this attack with all its might. The 3d Infantry will be
known as a reserve, and it will be under your orders; until
further orders it ought to take up a position in some
sheltered place to the west of Square Corners. Before it
starts out, however, it ought to send its machine gun company,
without further delay, so that the company may
report to the commander of the 1st Infantry as soon as
practicable. You give all this order to your regimental
commanders after they have been assembled—in fact, you
read it off to them. With the regimental commanders
have been assembled also Major Black of the 7th Field
Artillery, and the officers in charge of the ambulance company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and the officers of your staff. You are going to send
a copy of this order by the aide to your Division Commander.
You are going to have a station at the reserve
where you will be in touch with any messages that might
come in—in fact, all the messages ought to be sent there.
You want the cavalry to cover your left flank, and you
want a strong patrol sent in the general direction of the
west and also of the south. Before you finished writing this
order you found out that the bridges over the Platte River
were all destroyed. The Platte River runs along the rear
of the enemy. All those bridges which are between Platte
City and Farley you know are destroyed; you hear also
that the enemy is at work repairing them. From all the
messages and all sources of information which you can
assemble, you estimate that it will require two or three
hours to make these bridges safe for troops. You want
the 1st Battalion of the 7th Field Artillery to move out
straight to the south and to take up a position 500 yards
south of where you are writing your message. When the
artillery gets there, you want it to open fire just as soon
as it can on the enemy’s position wherever that might be.
You want your artillery to make the enemy’s artillery a
target, and to develop that target as soon as possible.</p>

<p>9.—On the 17th of May, 1919, you are in command of
the 1st Division of the 18th Corps. Your division is encamped
near Mt. St. Mary’s. You want your division to
attack the enemy right away and you want him to go
around so he will develop the left of the enemy. Your first
ambulance company ought to follow the Field Artillery to
where Hampton Valley starts, and it ought to stay there
until further orders. Your second ambulance company
you want to go along with and follow the 3d Brigade.
This ambulance company ought to go as far as the crossing
of Beaver Branch, and then it should stay there and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
not go away until further orders. The third and fourth
ambulance companies should not move out at all, but ought
to park somewhere near the road near the place called
Rodey. The field hospitals will not move out at all, but
ought to stay until you send them orders to the contrary.
In the place called Thurmont, there ought to be a collecting
station for the slightly wounded. Your first artillery
ought to move out at once down Hampton Valley and take
a position somewhere near the road which runs through
Emmitsburg and along past St. Joseph’s Academy. The
2d Field Artillery should find a position and take it up
somewhere near Motters. The 3d Brigade, which we
found the second ambulance company was to follow, should
move out and then go along by Motters and launch an
attack on the enemy; the 3d Brigade ought to envelop the
enemy’s left. The left of the 3d Brigade ought to rest on
the line which runs through the place called Motters, and
also runs through Tom’s Creek Church. The Brigade
Commander of the 3d Brigade will have the general line of
the Monocacy Creek under observation of mounted men.
This line ought to be kept in under observation pretty well
south—in fact, to the mouth of Hunting Creek. The main
attack will be launched, as you figured, all along the front,
which is determined by a line running through St. Joseph’s
Academy and also running through Long’s.</p>

<p>The brigade commander of this brigade ought to detail
a battalion of infantry; the special duty of this battalion
will be to form an escort for the 1st Field Artillery which
it will accompany. One wagon company of artillery ammunition
will go down to the mouth of Hampton Valley.
You have heard that there is a great party of the enemy,
which has been estimated at say two-thirds of a division,
and that this big force is assembling and concentrating in
rear of the outlying timber. This fringe of timber extends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
from Tom’s Creek Church all the way north to near
Parkersburg. This hostile force averages about 50 yards
south of this timber. The first cavalry you feel ought to
cover your left. You feel that the reconnaissance that
it ought to take up must be strong, dashing, and vigorous,
and that it should reconnoiter east of the Monocacy. You
write your order, which is the third one during the year, at
9 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Your Signal Company will lay a line from the 1st Field
Artillery to the road-fork, 500 yards west of Round
Corners. A second line will be laid from the 2d Brigade
to the same road-fork. Your leading wagon company of
small arms ammunition should be placed just north of
Riley. You want to state to the remainder of your trains
that they are not to move out from there until they get
orders from you. You send copies of this order to Majors
Black, Cord, Darwin, Enfield, Colonel Forse, Major Good,
and Captain Harrow. You report by telegraph to your
Division Headquarters what you have said in your order.
The 2d Brigade is going to be your general reserve; it
should take up a position outside near the cross-roads.
This cross-roads that you mean is 1,500 yards west of
Motters. Any messages and reports which are going
to come to you, you want to have reach you at the road-fork,
which is about 2,000 yards west of the place called
Motters.</p>

<p>10.—You are Brigadier General Aaron in charge of a
detachment of the 1st Division. You are about to get out
your fourth field order of the campaign, which you issued
and signed at ten minutes to seven on the morning of
October 6, 1918. Your Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Bean.
The main body, of which you are a part, is engaged with
the enemy at the present time. The two bodies opposed
to each other, fighting strenuously, extend from near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Belmont School House toward the north. You want the
1st Infantry to advance via the 530-618 road, and you
want it to deploy whenever it is necessary for it to do so.
You want it to deploy with its left flank touching the 548-618
road. After it has done this you want it to attack at
the same time that the 2d Infantry does. Your artillery
you want to move out by way of the road which runs
through 542 and 550, and you want it to go so it will get
a position somewhere near the Hill 608; it will be escorted
by the 1st Battalion of the 2d Infantry. You want this
artillery to support the attack in the best way it can.
The 1st Battalion of the 2d Infantry should take up such
formation and movement as will best provide protection
for the left of your whole line. The whole of the 2d Infantry,
of course, excepting the first battalion, will advance
by 452. It will then take a cut across country
and then by the road which goes by 546 and 548. The
2d Infantry will attack the enemy’s right flank. The
cavalry should cover the left of your own troops and make
strong reconnaissance of the country to the north and
also to the west. A troop of this Cavalry should be sent
over to the right flank of our troops. The work of this
troop should be to get into communication and keep communication
with your main army by telegraph. You
want the Signal Detachment to give you wire communications,
or in fact, any kind of communications which will
best keep you in touch with the 1st Infantry. You are at
the cross-roads near Mt. Vernon School House when you
write your order. You have learned that there is a body
of the enemy, a rather large body in fact, which is going
into some position selected near Granite Hill. You gain
from reliable patrols all the above information, and also
the fact that this detachment of the enemy is about one-half
your own strength. You decide that you are going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
to attack at once this detachment which is just spoken of,
which is going into a position near Granite Hill. If it is
going into position, and if it is now only one-half your
strength, you can see that there are two reasons why
you must launch your attack with the utmost vigor and
celerity, because the enemy might gain reinforcements, or
a good position in the meantime. You state in your order
that you are going to be with the reserve all the time, and
you send copies to all your officers, especially to Major
Good who is commanding the cavalry, and you report
what you have done by telegraph to the Chief of Staff.
You decide to have the 3d Infantry be the reserve. If the
3d Infantry is the reserve and you are with it, it ought
to be under your orders. The 3d Infantry will follow
along behind the 2d Infantry until the latter regiment
deploys.</p>

<p>11.—You are Major General Plunkitt. On the 3d of
September, 1923, you are near the town of Guldens. You
are in command of the 4th Division of the 12th Corps.
You issue a written order by your Chief of Staff, who is
Lt. Col. Miley, at a quarter of eight in the morning of
this day. You propose that your division shall make a
vigorous attack upon the enemy, and that you will break
through his outpost line. Your intention is to go on
through with all speed to Gettysburg. You are going
to be near the Plank Farm when this is happening. The
two troops of cavalry who are now with your advance
guard, or really have just been with your advance guard,
are going to continue covering your left flank as they have
been doing. The 3d Brigade will march from near the
I. P. Plank Farm, and it will proceed north on the road
which runs north from that farm. Now, it will keep
going on that road until it gets to the woods and then it
will advance to the northwest of the railroad, and go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
against the enemy. The 2d Brigade and Engineer Battalion
are going to make up the reserve. They are going
to be under your orders directly, and they, in order to
make this attack successful will take a position somewhere
under cover northwest of Granite Hill. Colonel Field of
your cavalry will cover your right flank with those of his
regiment who are not covering the left. He ought to assemble
his main body right now somewhere on the Harrisburg
road. You are writing this 7th field order since the
first of the year at a quarter to eight in the morning when
information from officers’ patrols comes in that there is
only one division of the enemy in Gettysburg, and that he
has lost heavily by casualties in the fight you have had
with it the day before. You learn also at the same time
that there is an outpost line of the enemy, which is extending
from Body School House to McAllister Hill.
This outpost line crosses the road you are on and your
troops are on, at Hill 618; you find out also that Wolff
Hill is full of the enemy. The artillery of your command
you figure ought to take up some position to the west of
Granite Hill, and that it should open fire on the enemy as
soon as the enemy has been discovered. The Signal Company
should connect you and your headquarters with all
of the commanders of the first, third, and artillery Brigades.
You send copies of all these orders by Lieut.
Knight to your four brigade commanders, and also to the
officers in charge of the first section of your train; you
read it off to your staff, and you send a copy by an orderly
to the second section of your train. Your ambulance companies
are going to park near the right fork of 617, and
you are going to camp east of this fork, which is northeast
of Granite Hill. You want the first sections of your
trains to go and park at Guldens, and you want the second
section not to budge from where it is now stationed. Your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
first brigade should continue its advance along the road
you are on, and when it becomes necessary finally to deploy,
they should deploy across this road. After they have
deployed they ought to take up the attack at once and go
forward with Hill 618 as their objective. There are about
a thousand of your troops, you learn, who are wounded
in Gettysburg; then, too, there are many wounded who are
now held as prisoners of war in Gettysburg where a division
of the enemy is stationed, and where it has lost
heavily.</p>

<span class="fs90">MORE PROBLEMS OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE FIELD ORDER</span></h2>


<h3>(3) <span class="smcap">Order for Position in Readiness</span></h3>

<p>1.—You are Major General Tuttill in command of the
10th Division of the 3d Corps, which is at Taneytown.
On June 3, 1952, your division has been designated to keep
a certain force of the enemy out of a battle which is going
to take place with your whole army. This hostile force is
directly in your front. You determine therefore to take
up a position in readiness on the south side of Pipe Creek.
You have been encamped with the outpost. You want this
outpost and the cavalry which is attached to your command,
to watch out for the retirement of your whole division
to this position in readiness. After that, this whole
outpost is to withdraw to Keymar. They are to get to
Keymar by going over the road through Bruceville. The
commander of the outpost will be notified when he will
begin this withdrawal. The enemy, you have learned, is
directly in your front and has gone into camp along Piney
Creek near the village of Piney Creek toward the north.
The third brigade is to start at 4 o’clock in the morning
and is to march directly to Keymar, and the artillery
brigade, all but one battalion, will start out at the same
hour and will go around by Otterdale mill and will go to
Montunion Church. The first brigade should march the
very same hour with its destination to be near the vicinity
of a small amount of woods, which are about 1,000 yards
in a southerly direction from Trevanion. Your army on
this very day crossed the Monocacy. During the expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
they don’t meet with very much opposition, so
that they intend on the next day to attack the main body
of the enemy which is somewhere in the vicinity of Mt.
Ary. Your signal company should leave the third brigade.
When the signal company gets to Keymar, it should connect
up that place with the station of the first brigade; it
should put in on this line a station for the artillery brigade.
In addition, the signal company ought to keep up
a line of communication with the outpost until the outpost
is withdrawn. You, as the commanding general of this
division want to notify all your troops about a certain
fact which applies to every one—namely, that the staff
officers should go along with the infantry brigade before
mentioned, and should pick out and mark points which
are to be entrenched. Your engineer battalion will start
to march at the same hour as the other troops mentioned
above. They are to strike then across to Middleburg and
then they are to go to places which are to be picked out
by the chief of staff, and when they get to those places
they are to assist in the entrenching. You decide that you
are going to go to Taneytown and stay there until the outpost
is withdrawn. You want the field trains to start
out at three o’clock in the morning, and these should go
along and follow in the course which has been already
designated for the respective units to which the field trains
belong. These field trains are to cross the Pipe Creek
and are to assemble at Woodsburg. All the other columns
of the trains will start out at the same hour as the troops.
The ammunition columns and the two field hospitals are
to halt at Ladysburg; all the others halt at Woodsburg.
You issue this order at 10 o’clock in the evening and you
sign it yourself, and you send copies of this, your 10th
field order of the campaign, to all officers who come to
your headquarters to receive orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>


<h3>(4) <span class="smcap">The Defense Order</span></h3>

<p>2.—You are Major General Standish. You have just
received word that the enemy to which you are opposed has
been very heavily reenforced and has now about two divisions
in the town of Taneytown. Your main army is
not going to leave until the 19th, and then it will get as
far as Marshall probably. You are in command of the
21st division of the 8th corps, and you are south of Emmitsburg
on the 17th day of May, 1945. You decide that
you can’t do anything else but take up a defensive position.
You accordingly want to make your division occupy
a position extending from McKee Knob to the northeast.
You want the second brigade, which is going to be reenforced
by the first cavalry and also by the 2d battalion, 1st
field artillery to cover this movement, to take up a defensive
position. General Calhoun of the second brigade
has to put in place of the infantry of his brigade on the
southern line of outpost, certain cavalry patrols. These
cavalry patrols will come from two corps which have been
sent to General Calhoun, or at least have been ordered to
report to him at Motters at one o’clock in the morning.
General Calhoun should relieve the outpost of the third
brigade at two o’clock in the morning, and of the first at
three o’clock in the morning. The first brigade, after its
outpost is relieved, should immediately take up the march,
going up the road which runs through Emmitsburg and
Liberty Hall School House. It should halt when it gets
northeast of 656. General Calhoun has to be placed in
command in order to carry out his part of the situation as
to certain other troops—in fact, the 2d battalion of the
1st field artillery, and the 1st cavalry, should now become
a part of his command. The 2d battalion of the 1st field
artillery is at the northeastern outskirts of the town of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Emmitsburg, and the 1st cavalry has its headquarters at
Fairplay; he will begin to command these troops at two
o’clock in the morning. You write, at 11 o’clock at night,
your sixth field order and send copies by Lieut. Fright to
Generals Byrd, Carr, Dale, and to Colonel Fink and Captain
Hervey. You read the message off to your staff and
report by telegraph to army headquarters what you have
done. You decide to have your third brigade, after this
outpost is relieved, march by way of Emmitsburg from
Four Points. Then the brigade is to march by the road
just east of McKee Knob to a position half a mile north
of 587; there the brigade will halt. General Calhoun
should delay the crossing of the river by the enemy. He
should do this as much as he is able, but he should not become
too closely engaged with the enemy. You decide that
you will be at Emmitsburg until after 5 o’clock in the
morning; then you are going to be at Liberty Hall School
House. The signal company will take up what lines it has
laid down after two o’clock in the morning. Then one-half
of the company will report to Brigadier General Calhoun,
and the remainder of the signal company will
proceed to join the 3d brigade. You want your entire
command to know that there is to be on no occasion any unnecessary
noise and that this noise is to be avoided at all
hazards. You do not wish a bugle call to be sounded before
the sun rises.</p>

<p>3.—On the 4th of June, 1964, you are Major General
Boswell in command of the first division of the fourth army
corps. Your division is west of Gettysburg. You hear
that the enemy in your front is at Cashtown and has been
heavily reenforced. The troops for these reenforcements
have come from his main army. This gives you the idea
that you had better take up a defensive position; you had
better take up this position astride the road which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
now are on and you must hold this position throughout the
day. Your third brigade should start right away to make
preparations for the defense. They should take up a line
in their defense preparations extending from somewhere
east of Seven Stars, and should continue this line to the
southwest for about three-quarters of a mile. The first
cavalry should send two platoons to report to the Major
who commands the engineer battalion near Moonsburg.
These should be sent if the enemy advance in force, and
they should be sent with the patrol on your right flank.
The main body of this cavalry should patrol the left of
your line to cover it. The 2d brigade will prepare for defense
a line extending from near Seven Stars northwest.
It should extend this line until it reaches the farm road
which crosses the ridge. The 1st brigade will be the
reserve. They are going to be under your direct orders;
they should therefore remain midway between Knoxburg
and 597. There is a road fork there where they should
stay. The engineer battalion will go at once and prepare
the high ground southwest of Moonsburg for defense, and
in this defense which they will make at this point, they are
to act as a right flank guard. The ambulance companies
will be held near the north end of Herr Ridge. You have
a second field hospital which you have established at
Gettysburg and you want it to stay there. You want your
first, third, and fourth field hospitals at the western outskirts
of Gettysburg. You want these first, third, and
fourth field hospitals to assemble by the road somewhere
there. Company A of your signal corps you decide to
have lay certain lines. All these lines should go from the
position of the reserve to the second field artillery, and
on this line there should be a station so that the commander
of the second brigade could cut in, and then Company
A also should lay a line from the first field artillery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
to the reserve. On this line also, the commander of the
third brigade should have a station where he can go. The
signal company also ought to arrange to have receiving
stations for flag signals for the engineer battalion, and
ought to do the same thing for the cavalry on the left
flank. Two wagon companies of small arms ammunition
should be held near 585, and another wagon company of
artillery ammunition near 587. You are going to be
at Division Headquarters at 597. Your second field
artillery should set out at once to the road leading southwest
about half a mile from Moonsburg; it should move
around the Moonsburg road to do this. It should then
go by this road, which leads southwest, to an intersection
of that road to the next farm road. The Colonel of the
second field artillery should prepare a position in this
vicinity which would be capable of supporting the entire
line of defense when this line was attacked. The first field
artillery should go about half a mile south of this camp;
it should proceed around by the road parallel to the
Chambersburg road, and should go as far as a point one
mile south of Seven Stars. When it gets there it should
select and prepare a position to support the defense. You
want all the other trains which you have not mentioned
not to move out from where they are, but want them to be
ready to move in any direction at your command. You
know that your main army is going to attack the weaker
hostile force, which is in its front, on the very morning
your order is issued. You also know that if your own
army is successful in this attack, it will send you later
some reenforcements if you really need them. You write
this order at twenty minutes of five in the morning. You
send copies of this, your sixth field order, since the beginning
of the campaign, to all officers who have been sent
under your order to receive them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>


<h3>(5) <span class="smcap">Retreat Order</span></h3>

<p>4.—On May the 2d, 1919, at 4 a. m., you wish copies
of this your 12th field order since the beginning of the
year sent to the commanders of the first brigade, the
artillery brigade, and the 10th cavalry by Lieut. Alber;
to the commanders of the second brigade, the engineer
battalion, the signal company, and the chief surgeon by
Captain Cutts; to the commander of the third brigade, and
to Major Quincy by Sgt. Donohue. Your name is Major
General Slump. You are in command of the second division
of the third army corps. Your division is at Platte
City, Missouri. There are two divisions of the enemy who
are coming down against Platte City from the north.
You know this to be reliable information, and you know,
also, that one division of the enemy went into camp last
night before you found out that the outposts of that division
were six miles north of Tracy on the road that runs
through Tracy and Severn. The other division, you know,
camped six miles further to the north. You give, in your
order, the direction that the first brigade is to take up a
position on the west end of the farm road which runs west
from Nile. You want this brigade to be prepared to make
all sorts of resistance—in fact, you want it to delay the
enemy’s advance, and to hold this position until you order
it to retire further. You decide really that your whole
division should go into a position west of the Platte river.
Your idea is that it should hold back the enemy there, and
should hold it back sufficiently until the trains can be
withdrawn. When the trains are all withdrawn, then you
ought to be able to make an orderly retreat in the general
direction of the Nile. At the crack of dawn the next
day, you figure that the cavalry ought to begin going
out and looking for the enemy with all possible speed and
vigilance. And then, too, you think that the cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
ought to look out especially for your left flank. Your
second brigade should start out at ten minutes to five the
next morning. It should go to “E” and should close up
off the road near “E,” and should march by the B-D road.
This brigade is to be the second line and it should take up
such a position and be in such a state as to hold back any
movement of the enemy which should come in this direction.
If it is going to be necessary, this second brigade ought to
cover the troops of the first line who are withdrawing. The
engineer battalion should be ready to march out at half
past four; it ought to follow immediately behind the artillery
brigade until the engineer battalion gets somewhere beyond
Tracy. The signal company will be ready to march
at twenty-five minutes of five and to follow the battalion of
engineers until the signal company gets to the southeast
corner of Tracy. The advance should move out in this
way: the supply trains, the ammunition columns, the
bridge train, and the field hospital will march at a quarter
of four and they should march toward Leavenworth.
They should go by the road that runs two miles east of
Platte City through 56 and 54. The field train of the
first brigade will clear “15” at 4 o’clock. The field train
of the second brigade, the engineer battalion, the signal
company, ambulance companies, and division headquarters,
in the order named, will move out toward 56 at half
past five in the morning. These trains just enumerated
will follow the division trains. The baggage of the third
brigade, and the artillery brigade will proceed to Leavenworth
and will go by the road which runs through 56 and
54. The baggage will go any prescribed distance as far
as 50; during this move it will follow the third brigade.
You want Major Quincy to be put in charge of all the
division trains—in fact, you want him to be put in charge
of all the trains that join his column, and you want him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
to regulate the march. You want messages sent to you
between five o’clock in the morning and the time of the
withdrawal of the first line to the small orchard which is
between 13 and 15. After that time you want messages
sent to you at “12.” One section of your artillery ammunition,
and one section of your small arms ammunition are
to be at a point between 50 and 52 at six o’clock in the
morning. All the other sections of the ammunition column
will be on the road between Alexander and “50” after one
o’clock in the morning. The ambulance companies will
march at 5:30 a. m., and park by the road near “B.” The
road fork at “14” will be the collecting station for the
slightly wounded. The artillery brigade will get into position
as follows: one regiment about one mile north of “15,”
the other somewhere near a mile north on the road 1,100
yards northwest of 13. The artillery command should
open fire as soon as the enemy is seen anywhere, or, in any
strength, at any time.</p>


<h3>(6) <span class="smcap">Pursuit Order</span></h3>

<p>5.—You are Major General Jervey in command of the
12th division 6th corps. You have just defeated the
enemy, and you have defeated him so badly that he is retreating
in great disorder in the direction of Gettysburg.
You are near Cashtown when you issue your 12th field
order of the campaign. It is twenty minutes to four in
the afternoon, June 12, 1925, when you issue to your
brigade commanders, and to Lt. Col. Miles, Colonel Forse,
Major Good, and Captain Harrow copies of your order.
You decide to pursue the enemy without any delay. You
want your second brigade, which is now without the 6th
infantry which ordinarily belongs to that brigade, to reform
itself, and you want the second brigade at half past
four to follow the third brigade in the general direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
of Gettysburg. The third brigade, which is under the
command of Brigadier General Dunn, you think ought to
advance at once. You are going to reenforce it, however,
with the second infantry, the second field artillery, and the
first cavalry. The third brigade ought, by all reasonable
surmise, to drive the enemy inside of Gettysburg or even
beyond Gettysburg. After the third brigade with this reenforcement
has done so, it ought to seize the whole of the
McPherson Ridge and hold it. Two companies from the
second brigade ought to be detailed to report to the division
surgeon there. They should assist him in policing
all the field. You are going to be at Seven Stars as soon
as you can get there and you are going to start at five
o’clock. All but one squadron of the first cavalry will
move out by the north of Gettysburg. You plan that it
shall be the first cavalry’s object to interrupt communication
and delay traffic on the railroad there, and then it
ought to reconnoiter in the general direction of the east.
The first brigade you think ought to follow the first field
artillery. The first brigade you figure should select two
companies from its organization and detail them to report
to the division surgeon. Those two companies should
assist in policing all the battle-field. The first field artillery
will follow the second brigade: this regiment should
detail an officer and thirty men, and this officer and thirty
men ought to do the same thing as the two companies
from the first brigade were detailed to do. The division
will have entire charge of the policing of the field. A
field hospital ought to be established at Cashtown. Cars
will be available for the division surgeon by five o’clock at
Ortanna. The evacuation of the wounded, therefore,
should be through Ortanna. The whole of the first battalion
of engineers will report to the division surgeon and
go under his orders.</p>

<h3>(7) <span class="smcap">Halt Order</span></h3>

<p>6.—You are Brigadier General Short; you are in command
of a detachment from the first division. You have
just decided that your whole command should go into
camp for the whole night. Your command is at Bonnyville.
You want to let your troops know that your cavalry
has come in contact with hostile cavalry, and that this
attack was made near Whitehall. About an hour after
the issue of your message your cavalry drove back the
hostile cavalry toward Littlestown. You want the second
infantry to camp in a field southwest of the town in which
your division is now located. You want your first battalion
of your fourth artillery to camp in a field northwest
of the same town. You understand from a patrol
which has just reported to you, that at noon a column of
the enemy was on the march going west, and that at that
time the advance guard of this column of the enemy was
at Center School House. You decide to place the first
infantry in a camp northwest of Sweet Home School
House. There this first infantry is to establish an outpost.
The outpost is to extend from Hill 627 on the
north, along through St. Luke’s Church up into a place
called Coshun. You want to notify the first infantry of
your command, that in case it is attacked, the line which
has just been designated will be the one to be held. Your
third infantry you want to have camp in a field north of
the town in which you are. You want your field trains to
join their organizations; that is, the organization to which
they ordinarily belong, and you want this done right away.
You yourself at your own headquarters are going to camp
where the main street comes out of the western end of
this town at which you are located. At one o’clock in the
afternoon of June 2, 1930, you deliver this order verbally
to your advance guard commander, to all your columns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
of infantry, to your artillery commander, and all your
staff; you send one of your aides with a copy of the order
to Major Kline of the fifth cavalry, Captain Quigley who
is in charge of the train, and to Captain Supple of the
signal corps. This is the 7th field order you have written
in this campaign. Signal Company A is to be camped
west of the second infantry, and the first ambulance company
is to be near the signal company. All the ammunition
companies are to be camped near the farm house
called Lawrence. The first squadron of the 5th cavalry
ought, you figure, to camp somewhere near and west of
the artillery.</p>

<p>7.—The enemy has been retreating; he is continuing his
retreat. Your troops know that he has been retreating,
but they do not know that he is continuing his retreat. In
fact, he is retreating in great disorder. He is retreating
in such great disorder that he is offering no show of
resistance to any of your troops who are pursuing him.
You are Major General Plight in command of the first
division of the first army corps. You are on the Baltimore
Turnpike near White Run. You decide to have
your advance guard camp north of Two Taverns and to
establish an outpost line. They are to have a line of
observation and keep on the alert on that line of observation
which will extend from Bonnyville through Germantown
to the cross-roads at 568. The first brigade will
come between the two branches of White Run, which are
north of the road just mentioned. The artillery brigade,
with one battalion gone, will camp along the road which
runs through the western branch of White Run. The ambulance
companies, you figure, should camp south on the
road just mentioned and west of White Run. Your division
headquarters you decide to have placed west of the
farm house. This farm house is located west of where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
road you are on crosses over Rock Creek. You wish to
tell your command that orders will be issued from these
headquarters at nine o’clock. Your whole command, you
decide, should halt for the whole night. Your second
brigade should camp just north of the road where you are
located, and just west of a road known by the name of Low
Dutch. This 2d brigade should have a detached post
which it will detail for outpost duty. Such a post should
be in observation of the cross-roads at 530. This cross-roads
is just west of the Mt. Vernon School House. The
engineer battalion should camp south of the road you are
on and east of White Run. The signal company should
camp at a spot where the road you are on goes across
Rock Creek. You want the signal company to lay a wire
from there to the outpost, and you want the signal company
to have a station on this wire or line at a place indicated
by 489. You want your outpost to know that if
they are attacked they will be supported by you. You
give copies of this order to the officers who are sent from
the various commands to get the orders. You issue the
order at a quarter after two in the afternoon of June 2,
1935. They are the 77th field orders you have issued in
this campaign. Your field trains ought to join their
commands right off. You want the remaining trains to
go into park on the main battle-field of Gettysburg. You
decide that issues of supplies will be best made from the
supply column and that these issues should be made at
half past five in the morning. The place you decide from
which such issues should be made is 523. Your supply
wagons, which have been emptied, ought to proceed to
Ortanna for the night. There they should fill up with
supplies and come back and join early the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>


<h3>(8) <span class="smcap">The Outpost Order</span></h3>

<p>8.—You are Colonel Fluke of the 99th infantry, and
you are located near Bonnyville. You decide to establish
an outpost, and you decide that your regiment should go
into camp in the vicinity of Sweet Home School House.
The outpost should extend from Hill 627 at the northern
extremity, and then go on through St. Luke’s Church, and
should extend to the right fork at 587 at its southern
extremity. This road fork at 587 is south of the Coshun
place. You want the line of support to be held if you
are attacked. Your line of support will be at one, two,
three, four, and five, in order. Your support No. 1 will
take a position near the road fork at 587, about a mile
southwest of Bonnyville. This support will cover the
sector from the stream on the west to the first stream on
its east both inclusive. Frequent patrols will be made to
the Baltimore Turnpike. You issue this, your first field
order, at half past one on the afternoon of June 2, 1950.
You deliver this order in person by reading it after you
have assembled all your field officers, your staff officers,
and your company commanders. You decide that you
will be at the Sweet Home School House during the continuation
of the outpost. Your cavalry on this very day
came in contact with some cavalry of the enemy. About
noon at Whitehall this occurrence took place. There your
cavalry drove back the enemy’s cavalry toward Littlestown.
From reliable patrols you get a report that at
noon, the very same time that this occurrence took place, a
large column of the enemy was seen to be coming west.
The head of the advance guard of this platoon of the
enemy was then at Center School House. Your Support
No. 1, in command of Captain Link, will consist of Company
G and four mounted scouts. Support No. 3, you
decide to go into a position near St. Luke’s Church. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
ought to be responsible for the sector of ground which
you designate to extend from the stream about 500 yards
south of St. Luke’s Church, on to a farm house 1,000
yards northeast from a point 500 yards south of St.
Luke’s Church. You wish to include both these extremities
in the sector of Support No. 3. Support No. 3 ought
to patrol the road which runs past Whitehall School
House. The reserve ought to camp near the Sweet Home
School House. Support No. 5 should take a position on
the north slope Hill 627; the duty of Support No. 5 ought
to consist of connecting with Support No. 3, and of covering
by their observations the road forks of 601 and 598.
Support No. 5 will consist of 2d Lieut. Prince and the
first section of Company I. Support No. 4 should go
and take a position at a point on the Hanover road. This
point is the place where the Hanover road joins with the
Bihl farm road. Support No. 4 will cover the ground
around Support No. 3, and the road fork at 597. This
road fork is north of Square Corners. Support No. 4
will include in its observations the points mentioned as the
extremities of this section. Support No. 2 should take
a position somewhere near the road fork of 617; this road
fork is just about a mile and a quarter south of the camp
where you are. Support No. 2 should cover the territory
which is included in the ground around the stream, which
is west on the road for 617, to a point 500 yards east of
this road fork. The reserve should consist of the first infantry,
of which five companies will already have been
taken out, and also fourteen scouts. You want the wagons
of the field trains to go ahead right away and join the
organizations to which they ordinarily belong. Support
No. 3 is to be under the command of Captain Nutt, and is
to consist of Company H and six mounted scouts. Those
wagons of the field trains, which belong to the companies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
in support, will join the wagons of the regimental headquarters;
they will do this by eight o’clock in the evening.
Support No. 3, under the command of Captain Nelson,
will consist of Company I, excepting the first section, and
two mounted orderlies. Support No. 2, under the command
of Major King, will consist of the second battalion,
all except Companies G and H and will also consist of
four mounted scouts. You want to tell your troops that
your brigade to which your regiment belongs is about to
go into camp in the vicinity of Bonnyville.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">March Orders with Advance and Rear Guard</span></h3>

<p>9.—On the 4th of September, 1956, you are Major
Britton. You are in command of the fourth division of
the 19th army corps and you are about to issue an order
which will keep your division on the march on the next
morning; you have been marching. At 10 o’clock at night
you issue your order near Abbottstown, stating that you
yourself are going to be at the head of your main body.
You feel that you should march in the general direction of
York on the next day. Your main body in this order of
march will consist of the first infantry, of the second battalion
of the 8th field artillery, of the third brigade, of
signal company “D,” and of the four ambulance companies.
Your main body should move out so as to come
along behind the advance guard, so that the tail of the
advance guard will be 1,000 yards ahead of the head of
the main body itself. Wagon trains should move out so
that they in turn will come along behind the main body,
so that the head of the lead horses will be 1,000 yards behind
the tail of the main body. You are in such a position
between two large forces of the enemy that you must
have a rear guard. This rear guard will be in command
of Major General Huff. It will consist of the first cavalry
division, of the second brigade, of the 7th field artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of the 4th battalion of engineers, and of the 1st, 2d, and
3d ambulance companies. You hear that the enemy has
probably been reenforced and that this reenforcement
probably consists of a brigade of cavalry. You also hear,
just when you issue this, your 7th field order of the campaign,
that there are some hostile infantrymen near York,
say, about a brigade. The rear guard, you figure, ought
indeed to keep the enemy in check. A rear guard of this
nature ought to resist any advancement on the part of
the enemy until your advance guard can open a road
through York. The first cavalry division, you have
knowledge, is bivouacking near where you are. It has,
indeed, reported for duty in connection with the work of
the division.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The idea of the last two chapters has been to put a
jumbled military decision into good working form. The
object has not been <ins class="corr" id="tn-109" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'to salve tactical'">
to solve tactical</ins> problems, but rather
to put the ideas correctly expressed into their logical
places.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br><br>

<span class="fs90">THE VERBAL FIELD ORDER</span></h2>


<p>“The initial combat orders of a division are almost
invariably written; those of the brigade are generally so.
The written order is preferable and is used wherever time
permits. Subsequent orders are likewise written either as
field orders or messages.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In chapters VII and VIII we
actually practiced the expression of the field orders for
the higher units. We illustrated to ourselves how difficult
it was to express disordered and straggling thoughts in
the most direct way. We did this work for two purposes:
first, to gain facility in dealing with language, and second,
to go through with a part of the mental process demanded
of commanders in the field. We should have
found out how perplexing it is to put the new-born decision
into form.</p>

<p>We now progress in our development to a more difficult
performance. We are going to discard our pencil. Just
as we took up the practice of speaking a field message after
we had been drilled in writing it, so here we are going to
learn to dictate the field order after we have been schooled
in composing it.</p>

<p>“The initial combat orders of regiments and smaller
units are given verbally. For this purpose the subordinates
for whom the orders are intended are assembled,
if practicable, at a place from which the situation and
plan can be explained. Subsequent orders are verbal or
are in the form of verbal or written messages.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The verbal
field order, then, may be divided into two classes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>(1) The initial combat order.</p>

<p>(2) The subsequent order, in the form of a field message.</p>

<p>Number 1 follows implicitly the sequence of the body of
the written field order. Number 2 follows the form of the
written or verbal message.</p>

<p>What really happens in action is this. A regiment or
battalion commander, after he has arrived at a decision
by way of his estimate of a situation, assembles his subordinate
officers. He recites to them his order. He points
out on the map and on the ground the various places to
which he refers in his order. He gives an opportunity,
when he has finished, for his officers to ask questions. He
then dismisses them.</p>

<p>The asking of questions is delaying. It mars efficiency;
and it points either to faulty expression on the part of the
commander or to inattention on the part of his audience.</p>

<p>After the subordinates have returned to their commands
and have set out upon the accomplishment of the
mission, it is of course impossible to reassemble them during
the progress of the engagement. Often, too, the
colonel or major desires to issue instructions to but one or
two officers of the command at a time. Number 2, therefore,
becomes the natural means of communication until
the conflict is over or the situation is passed. When a new
situation arises the commander assembles his officers as
before, and the procedure throughout is repeated.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, now, that a colonel, faced with a new
or changed situation, wishes to make his will known to his
subordinates. When his officers are assembled he speaks
as follows:</p>

<p>“It is reliably reported that two battalions of the enemy
are entrenching on that hill (he points out the hill) one
mile to the southeast of here. Their position extends from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the Jordan River to the Wellington Road, both inclusive.
Our main body is at Tarrytown. (He points toward
Tarrytown both on the ground and map.) We will attack
at once enveloping the enemy’s left.</p>

<p>The First Battalion will attack the hostile trenches
from the Jordan River, exclusive, to the Darlington
House, exclusive. The Second Battalion will attack the
hostile trenches from the Darlington House, inclusive, to
the west, and will envelop the enemy’s right. The Third
Battalion and machine gun companies, in reserve, will follow
the Second Battalion. Ambulances and combat
wagons will assemble at Main Station. Battalions will
maintain semaphore communications with the reserve
where I shall be.”</p>

<p>The Regimental Adjutant writes down this order immediately
after its issue, gives it its proper heading and
ending, and files it away. It thus becomes a written field
order and a part of the records of the regiment. Copies
of it are sent to higher commanders.</p>

<p>Let us imagine that the attack is well under way, and
that the regiment is holding its own, but is not progressing
as it should. The colonel decides to increase the size
of the enveloping body. He therefore calls a staff officer
to him and says:</p>

<p>“Go over to Major Swift, in command of the third
battalion, and tell him to send K and L Companies to extend
our right. Repeat.”</p>

<p>The staff officer replies,—“I am to go to Major Swift,
in command of the third battalion and am to say to him
that the Regimental Commander directs him to have K
and L Companies extend the right of our line.”</p>

<p>We must notice that the initial field order, when spoken,
has exactly the same arrangement and brevity of expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
as when written. Of course, the heading and ending
are omitted. But the distribution of troops, if necessary
for small units, would follow what would be paragraph 2
in a written order. The relation which exists between the
verbal and written message holds true in principle for the
field order.</p>

<p>In the following problems read over the matter several
times. Put it in orderly arrangement in your mind before
you speak. Then utter it in the most brief and unmistakable
form.</p>

<p>Cautions.—(1) <em>Only oral solutions will prove valuable
in working these problems. The student should make
only such notes as will enable him to carry the problem in
his mind. Proper notes would include the organizations,
their present situations, etc.—things which an actual commander
would know as a matter of course.</em></p>

<p>(2) <em>Once begun on the order, the student should pay
no heed to a false start, but should continue to the end.
It is better to remake the entire order, than to patch the
faults. He should not permit himself to change a previous
statement, begin a new sentence in the midst of an
unfinished one, or hesitate unreasonably. He must take
care not only to express the matter in proper form, but
also to enunciate so distinctly that any one within hearing
may understand him.</em></p>

<p>Intentional rhetorical errors will be found in the problems
which follow. Watch for them.</p>


<h3>PROBLEMS IN THE VERBAL FIELD ORDER</h3>

<p>1.—You are Colonel Foote, halted with your regiment
in Goldenville. You have previously sent out Lieutenant
Lasker toward Gettysburg for information. He has just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
sent you a message. You have made up your mind from
the facts in his message that you will march south at once
and that you will march in the direction of Gettysburg.
You desire the first battalion and the Machine Gun Company
to be the Advance Guard for your regiment. The
remainder of the regiment will follow the first battalion in
order as follows: second battalion, third battalion, band,
and ambulances. The field trains are not to move out but
are to stay behind until they get orders from you. They
are to remain at Texas. The message from Lieutenant
Lasker stated that about a regiment of the enemy was
throwing up intrenchments north of Penn College. The
message also stated that about half of the regiment of the
enemy consisted of recruits. You want the main body of
your regiment to follow the tail of the Advance Guard so
that there will be a distance of a half mile between the tail
of the Advance Guard and the head of the main body.
You want to notify your troops where the Regimental
Headquarters will march so that the troops will know
where to send messages. You decide to have the Headquarters
march between the Advance Guard and the main
body. The Advance Guard is to march at once and it is
to proceed south by way of the Hamilton Farm and the
Boyd School House. You assemble your majors, their
staffs and your staff, and you issue verbally the decision
which you have just made. You issue it in the shape of
a verbal order.</p>

<p>2.—You are Major Black in command of the Advance
Guard mentioned in the preceding problem. It is now
your mission, of course, to form the advance guard and
to tell your captains that you are going to do so, and that
you are going to be reinforced by the machine gun company.
You ought also to tell them just where your regiment
is going to march. You want Companies C and D and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the machine gun company to march in the order mentioned,
and they are to follow Company B as soon as that
company has got its distance. Company C will be the
company which is to regulate the pace. Company A is to
go out and act as a left flank guard. It is to move by way
of the eastern branch of the Carlisle Road while it is on
this duty. You ought also to let your captains know
all the information about the enemy which has been given
to you by your colonel. You want Company B to be the
advance party; you want it to go ahead of the remainder
of the battalion so that there will be four hundred yards
distance between it and the main body. You want to
attach Lieutenant Kay, the Battalion Adjutant, and his
orderly, to Company B. You want to direct the march of
the advance party so that it will know where it is to go.
You decide that it shall go by the railroad to the Carlisle
Road, and then by the Stock Farm, and on down to the
Boyd School House. You are going to be right behind the
advance on the march. You want the combat wagons to
move out right away, and you want them to go by the
cross-roads which is one-quarter of a mile west of Goldenville,
and then south on the Carlisle Road, and finally, to
join the tail of Company D where the railroad crosses the
road.</p>

<p>3.—You are the Company Commander of Company A
of the preceding problem. You call your officers and non-commissioned
officers together and you give them a verbal
order. You tell them that your company is to march as
the flank guard of the battalion to which you belong, and
you tell them that the enemy possibly has about a regiment
in Gettysburg; at least, that is the belief of the Regimental
Commander. Your regiment is on its way to Gettysburg.
The First Battalion and the machine gun company is
going as the advance guard. You want to let your command
know that all of the battalion, except yourselves is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
leaving on the road to the west. You want Lieutenant
Johnson, the Second Lieutenant of your company, and the
Fourth Platoon, to act as the advance guard to the flank
guard, which is the duty on which the company is acting.
You want this platoon to march by the country road east
of the knoll marked 651, and then you want it to march
along the east branch of the Carlisle Road. The distance
you decide upon for the advance guard to be in front of
the main body is 500 yards.</p>

<p>4.—You are Major Simpson, and you are halted with
your battalion at the cross-roads 621, near Goldenville.
Your mission is, with your battalion, to act as outpost
during the coming night for your regiment; you have the
machine gun company attached to you. You are operating
toward the south. You want company C and one of
the platoons of the machine gun company to take station
on the ridge north of the point where you are. This ridge
has the figure 707 on it. It shall be the duty of this detachment
to secure that sector between Goldenville and
Five Forks, just a little off the map, about 1,500 yards
west of the Carlisle Road. You want Company C to establish
communication with Texas by signals on this hill, where
they are to be located. If you are going to be attacked on
that hill, instead of falling back, you want them to hold
the ridge. You want a platoon of Company C to be sent
over to Hamilton Farm to act as a picket there. You
have received reports from Lieutenant Finley of your
command that there are no detachments of the enemy or
patrols which have come north of the Stock Farm at any
time. You want to tell your captains that the remainder
of the outpost is going into camp at Texas, and that the
regiment itself is moving into camp just north of the
Conewago. You want the rations and baggage of Company
C to be sent up to the company, but you want the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
wagons to be returned immediately after they have been
there, to Texas for the night.</p>

<p>5.—You are in command of Company C which was to go
to Hill 707 in the preceding problem. You want to notify
your company what you are going to do; in other words,
you want to deliver to them verbally your field order.
For this purpose you assemble your officers and non-commissioned
officers and the lieutenant who is in charge of
the machine gun. You state that the outguards will be
posted as follows: Corporal Browning, with his squad as
No. 1, is to be posted at the Five Forks 679, three-quarters
of a mile west of where you are; Corporal Martin,
with his squad as No. 3, is to be posted at the road-fork
numbered 621, which is on the Carlisle Road; Corporal
Denton, with Privates Noonan, Ogden, and Prince will go
as No. 4. His post will be posted at the railroad crossing
in Goldenville. You, as Company Commander, deliver the
information about the enemy which has been received
through your major. Corporal Calhoun, with Johnson,
Kelly, and Latham are to go as No. 2, and they are to
be posted at the cross-roads 648, which is 500 yards west
of the point where you are located—Goldenville. You
state that this company and that a platoon of machine
guns is to take station on the ridge to the north of the
road on which you are located, and is to go as support to
the outpost. Lieutenant Haskins will take the 4th platoon
and will proceed as a picket down to the Hamilton Farm.
This farm is a mile and a quarter south of here on the
Carlisle Road. Lieutenant Haskins is to get some sort
of flag communication with Hill 707. He is also to send
small patrols down as far south as Boyd’s School House.
Corporal Roberts will go to the top of Hill 707; he will
take four signalers with him. He will get in communication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
with Texas and keep in communication. He will do
the same for each one of the outguards and he will also
do the same for Lieutenant Haskins’ picket.</p>

<p>6.—You are Major Perkins and you are in command
of a squadron of cavalry. You are between Goldenville
and the bottom of the map. You receive word that the
enemy is somewhere to the north, and you get messages
from your commanding officer stating that you are to go
as independent cavalry for your brigade. Reports also
come in to you that the enemy, which consists of about
1,000 men, is occupying Carlisle. You have assembled
your captains, and you state to them that Troop A will
make up the Advance Guard. You state also, that it will
keep a small patrol about two or three miles to the front
in the direction in which it is going. You tell Troop A,
also, that its average rate of speed should be about four
miles per hour, and that this rate includes halts. You
know that your main body is going to march at 6 o’clock
the next morning in the direction of Carlisle and you know
that it is only going to advance 15 miles on that day. You
know, also, that it is going by the Gettysburg—Table
Rock—Center Mills—Carlisle Road. You want your main
body to follow the advance guard, which you have already
mentioned, so that there will be a distance between the advance
guard and the main body of about a mile. The main
body is to march from front to rear—Troops B, C, and D.
You wish to inform everybody present that Lieutenant
Butler and Sgt. Clifford are out with patrols and that
these patrols are very far out to the flank of the line of
march. You decide to ride in this march of the independent
cavalry near the head of the main body. You want
your officers to know that both of the patrols which you
have just mentioned are going to send reports to you, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
that these reports should arrive at the squadron when the
main body is about two miles north of the Conewago.
You desire wheel transportation of all kinds to join the
advance of the main body of infantry back near Gettysburg.</p>

<p>7.—You are Captain Small in command of Troop A of
the preceding problem. You are to constitute, as you
remember, the advance guard of the squadron of independent
cavalry. You wish to tell your officers and non-commissioned
officers, whom you have assembled, that
Lieutenant Butler and Sgt. Clifford are out with patrols,
and you want to give them the information you have got
from your major in regard to your own troops and the
enemy. You want Corporal Dillingham to take four men
and to go ahead of the troop. He is to go at a rate of
about six miles per hour until Conewago Creek is crossed;
after that, he is to go about four miles an hour. When he
gets about a mile north of Gettysburg he is to take the
right-hand road which goes through Table Rock and
Center Mills. He is to give quick and prompt warning of
the appearance of any of the enemy or hostile troops
which he encounters. He is also to report promptly any
places in the road which cannot be crossed by troops or
vehicles. In fact, he is to report any information which
will interfere with the march of the squadron. You, as
the captain of the troop, are going to march between the
advance party and the support.</p>

<p>8.—You are Major Adams and you are in command
of a squadron of cavalry which is mounted and ready for
action at D-6. You see a squadron of the enemy in an
open field to the west, about 600 yards west of the woods
where you are located. You see the guidons mounted,
and you see that the remainder of the men are leading their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
horses into line or are saddling up. You note, also,
through your glasses, that the guidons are facing in your
direction. You note, also, that the wagons have left the
camp and have gone around the woods just north. You
call your captains together and you issue a verbal order—you
have decided to attack the hostile squadron at once,
and to attack that squadron while you are mounted. You
want Troops D and C, commanded by Captain Denton,
who is senior to Captain Clifford, to form the main attacking
line. You want Captain Denton to take advantage of
an opening in the woods which is about 150 yards to your
front. He is to attack the enemy in close order, mounted,
as soon as he has cleared the woods in which you are all
located. You give to the captains the information which
you have got through your field glasses. You also state
that Captain Billings with his troop, Troop B, is to go
in rear of Troops D and C and form the supporting line,
keeping a distance of about 150 yards, and at the same
time he is to look out for the right flank. You want Lieutenant
Fink, who is the squadron adjutant, and who has
seen the same things through his glasses as you have seen,
to accompany Captain Denton with his two troops to the
edge of the woods, where he is to point out to Captain Denton
the enemy’s position. You yourself are going to be
with the reserve. Captain Andrews with his troop, Troop
A, is to constitute the reserve. Captain Andrews with his
command is to follow the attacking line at a distance of
400 yards. He is to echelon his command with the left
flank. You want the whole command to move out at once.</p>

<p>9.—You are General Temple and you are 700 yards
northwest of Hermans with your brigade when you receive
a message from Lieutenant Kline, Aeroplane No. 7. The
substance of this message states that the left of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
has extended itself by a battalion from a regiment which
is northwest of 501 cross-roads. He also states that there
is another battalion from a regiment near 504, and that
this battalion is moving toward Varney. He states that
there is a regiment of artillery posted on Oak Ridge, and
that there is another regiment of artillery which has its
right flank at the Stock Farm and its left flank near 531
road fork. You assemble your regimental commanders
and your cavalry commander; also, your artillery commander.
You state that the artillery battalion which is
with you is to go into a position near where you are and
that it is to operate against the artillery of the enemy and
the attacking infantry of the enemy. This your artillery
battalion is to do at first, but later it will support your
attack. The first battalion of the first infantry you want
to have assigned as a support to the artillery. You want
the first infantry, minus its first battalion which is going
to go as support to the artillery, to advance in the direction
of Herman’s Farm House; then it is to deploy and
attack. It is to attack so that the right of the regiment
will pass through the J. Weaver Farm House. The third
infantry is to be the reserve; it will be under your command
and it will move out and go forward to the Good
Intent School House. The first platoon of Troop A and
the first cavalry will take a position on the hill which is
designated by the figures 651. This platoon will cover
your right flank and report immediately any changes
which take place in the disposition of the enemy. Your
station for the slightly wounded will be at Table Rock.
You are going to be at the Good Intent School House,
where messages are going to reach you. Of course, you
give your officers whom you have assembled, the contents
of the aeroplane message which you received. You want
the infantry combat wagons to assemble at Table Rock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
and you want them to go there after all the troops have
cleared the road. You want the second infantry to get
under cover from the enemy and to go toward Hill 586;
this hill is northeast of Varney. When they are deployed
they will attack so that their left will pass through Hill
586.</p>

<p>10.—Major Quincy, in charge of the artillery battalion
of the preceding problem, assembles the captains of his
batteries and issues his instructions covered by the following
data: he wishes Batteries A and B to attack the hostile
artillery, and he wishes them to take up a position on the
north end of the field near where the brigade is halted.
He wants Battery C to go to Hill 592. From that point
he wants that Battery to attack the hostile infantry. He
gives to his commanders the information which was contained
in the aeroplane message of the preceding problem.
He also states that the enemy in superior force is attacking
from the west. He points out also that between 3,000
and 4,000 yards to the southwest can be seen a long line
of artillery of the enemy and that this artillery is in
action. He also states that the first battalion of the first
infantry, which is now marching down the road, which is
the support of the artillery, will occupy Hill 592. Battery
A’s target is to be the further half of the line of the
enemy’s guns, and Battery B’s target is to be the nearer
half. He states to his Battery Commanders that he has
already marked the position that they are to occupy with
their commands, and he tells them that they are to occupy
this position at once and prepare for immediate action.
He tells Battery A that the adjutant will give them the
firing data and they are to range by volleys. They are
to report to him when ready, and they are to be on the
alert and await his order to commence firing. He also
states that the advance cavalry is on the Hill 651 south<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
of Goldenville, and that they are covering the right of the
line. He wishes to tell his battery commanders that the
infantry is marching in a general direction south, and that
it is going from here to begin an attack against the left of
the enemy. He wishes to tell them also that he is to be,
during the action, on the left of Battery A.</p>

<span class="fs90">THE OPERATION ORDER, ORDERS, LETTERS OF INSTRUCTION</span></h2>


<p>Before August, 1914, the <em>Operation order</em> was the English
term for our <em>Field order</em>. Both orders had the same
functions and about the same form. At times, the term
<em>operation order</em> was used by us to include only battle
orders, but on the whole, the terms <em>Operation orders</em> and
<em>Field orders</em> practically amounted to American and English
designations of the same thing.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the present war, after a few weeks
of open conflict, this kind of fighting in France gave way
to a vast siege. The English found themselves, after some
cross-country fighting, in the trenches. There the operation
order which had provided for situations of march,
halt, bivouac, and battle, was gradually made over to suit
the peculiar needs of defenses, raids, and frontal attacks.
The barrage fire, bombs, mortars, machine guns, and intricate
lines of communication added to the number of details
to be considered. Little by little the will of the commander
expressed itself in such completeness that the former size
of his operation order passed all bounds. It was natural,
then, that although the scope and character of the English
order steadily changed, its name remained the same.</p>

<p>When the Americans came to take part in the war, the
operation order had during the previous years of struggle
developed out of all resemblance to its former self. It
was no longer a field order as we know the term. It was
fully grown to meet the tremendous progress of English
experience in the trenches. The consequence was that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
American, finding both the state of siege and the order to
cover it beyond his experience, associated the English name
with the novel warfare. Thus, today, the operation order
is a term used in connection with the disposition of troops
on the battle fronts of Europe.</p>

<p>We should bear in mind, then, that the operation order
is nothing more than a field order fitted to trench conditions.
We must not gain the idea that it has supplanted
the order which goes with mobile exercises on open ground.
Open warfare began this conflict, and will, provided it be
ended by martial victory, bring it to a close. Open warfare
has been the rule on the long Russian, Italian, Serbian,
Turkish, and Roumanian fronts. We must not be led
astray in our estimate of the proportions because the front
in France and Belgium is the most vital one to us from a
strategic standpoint. Field orders, which are the accompaniments
of open warfare, should still form the larger
part of our study.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the operation order is the order next in
importance to the field order. It must be framed with
mathematical precision under fire.</p>

<p>It has the greatest conciseness, but is not brief. It goes
into the minutest details, but its details are tersely put.
In certain parts it is telegraphic like the field message; in
others it has completed sentences like those of the field
order. It has an orderly arrangement of paragraphs and
brief and unmistakable language. If we are able to compose
a good field message and order, we should find, after
we have familiarized ourselves with the technique of the
trenches, that the construction of the operation order will
fall naturally into place in our minds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are forbidden to place an example
of one of our own operation orders upon these pages. But
we may have the opportunity of viewing a German one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
which contains the principles of our own. The example
given was issued by a regimental commander for a raid.
The action actually took place near La Boisselle, April
11, 1916.</p>


<p class="fs90">110th Reserve Infantry Regiment. In the field, 6th April, 1916.</p>

<p class="fs90 center smcap">Regimental Orders for a Raid on the Spion</p>

<div class="blockquotxx">

<p>1. The raid will probably take place at
dusk the 11th of April.</p>

<p>2. <em>Organization of the raiding party</em>—</p>

<p><em>In command.</em>—Captain Wagener, assisted
by Lieutenant Boening, Assistant-Surgeon
Wisser, one bugler and
six stretcher bearers.</p>

<p><em>Patrol commanders.</em>—Lieutenants
Stradtmann, Freund, Dumas, and
Böhlefeld.</p>

<p><em>Raiding party.</em>—50 men of the 110th
Reserve Infantry Regiment and four
Pioneers of the 1st Reserve Company,
13th Pioneer Battalion.</p>

<p>3. Upon the day fixed, <em>the raiding party</em>
will be assembled in Dug-outs Nos. 1-10, on
the right wing of the left-hand battalion.
Dug-out No. 9 will be used as advanced
regimental command post.</p>

<p>The assaulting party must not exceed
three officers and 30 men. The remaining
officers and men will be at Captain Wagener’s
disposal for use as supports.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Captain
Wagener’s
Orders—Appendix
1.</em></div>

<p>Shortly after dusk the assaulting party
will leave the Blaue Stellung by Sap No. 3
with the object of breaking into the enemy’s
position in the neighborhood of the Süd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Spion, from which point the enemy’s
trenches will be cleared northwards, if possible,
as far as the Spion. Unless prevented
by the enemy’s fire, the raiding party will
return to our Blaue Stellung by the same
way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Table of
distribution
of artillery
fire—Appendix
2.</em></div>

<p>4. For 25 minutes before the commencement
of the raid, <em>the artillery</em> will prepare
for the assault by shelling the enemy’s
trenches between Besenhecke and the Windmühle,
and also the Weisse Steinmauer.
During the raid the artillery will control
by its fire all the enemy’s trenches likely
to prove a source of danger to the enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Special
Orders for
feint
attack—Appendix
3.</em></div>

<p>5. In order to draw the fire of the enemy’s
artillery away from the spot to be
raided, a <em>feint attack</em> against the enemy’s
position just north of La Boiselle Cemetery
will start 15 minutes after the artillery
opens fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Special
Orders for
this bombardment—Appendix
4.</em></div>

<p>6. In order that the registration of the
objective by the heavy artillery and Minenwerfer
shall not be apparent, on the morning
of the day before the raid—probably
the 10th April—a feint bombardment of
Target-sectors 76-79 will be carried out,
combined with a mine explosion, <em>with the
object of misleading the enemy</em>. The exact
time will be fixed beforehand by the artillery
commander, Officer Commanding <ins class="corr" id="tn-127" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Ersatz Abeiltung'">
Ersatz Abteilung</ins>, 76th Artillery Regiment.</p>

<p>7. <em>The machine gun officer</em> will arrange
that, during the whole time of the raid, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
enemy’s rear trenches in Target-sectors 76-81
are kept under a constant fire, with a
view to causing him all possible loss, and, at
the same time, to safeguarding our patrol
against counter-attacks.</p>

<p>8. <em>The Officer Commanding 1st Reserve
Company, 13th Pioneer Battalion</em>, will arrange
for a gallery of the left-hand minefield
to be ready charged by the morning of
the day before the raid, and for a gallery
of the right-hand minefield to be ready
charged by the evening of the raid. The
former will be sprung at the conclusion of
the feint bombardment, the latter as an introduction
to the feint attack.</p>

<p>From today, the “earth mortars” (<i lang="de">Erdmörser</i>)
will systematically cut the enemy’s
wire opposite the Blinddarm. On the day
before the raid, they will coöperate with all
other close-range weapons to assist in the
feint bombardment of Target-sectors 76-78.
On the evening of the raid, they will assist
in the feint attack by bombarding Target-sectors
76 and 77 (<em>see</em> Appendices 3 and 4).</p>

<p>Throughout the raid, the “<i lang="de"><ins class="corr" id="tn-128" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Albrechtmörser'">
Albrecht-Mörser</ins></i>,”
in position on the Lehmgrubenhöhe,
will heavily bombard the enemy’s
trenches in the Nordrondell. Particular
care will be taken that the enemy’s machine
guns do not interfere with the raid from
that quarter (<em>see</em> Appendix 1).</p>

<p>9. <em>The Officer Commanding 228th
Minenwerfer Company</em> will register the enemy’s
wire at the point of entry with one
heavy and two medium Minenwerfer in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
course of the feint bombardment on the day
before the raid. He will also take part in
this bombardment and fire 30 medium
Minenwerfer shells at the Weisse Steinmauer
(<em>see</em> Appendix 4). On the afternoon
of the same day, with both medium Minenwerfer
mounted in the Minenwerfer Weg,
he will cut the enemy’s wire at 76y, and
throughout the whole night and the following
day will keep up a desultory fire.</p>

<p>On the evening of the raid, the wire in
front of the point of entry of the raiding
party will be cut on a width of 50 meters
by the heavy and two medium Minenwerfer
(<em>see</em> Appendix 1). Meanwhile, the two other
medium Minenwerfer will take part in the
feint attack against 76y (<em>see</em> Appendix 3).
The light Minenwerfer at the disposal of
the 228th Minenwerfer Company will take
part in the feint bombardment and in the
feint attack, in accordance with the orders
(para. 8) issued for the close-range weapons
of the 1st Reserve Company, 13th Pioneer
Battalion (<em>see</em> Appendices 3 and 4). The
Officer Commanding 228th Minenwerfer
Company will receive further detailed instructions
from Captain Wagener.</p>

<p>10. On the evening of the raid, <em>battalions</em>
will hold themselves in a state of readiness
for an alarm. Arrangements will be made
that, in the event of the enemy opening a
barrage on our trenches, as may well happen,
the number of sentries will be reduced
to a minimum. Gas masks and other gas
equipment must be held ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>11. I shall be at the regimental command
post from the morning of the day before
the raid. From 6 p. m. of the evening of the
raid, I shall be in the advanced regimental
command post in Dug-out No. 9 on the
right wing of the left-hand battalion. Captain
Wagener will maintain constant communication
with me. The artillery liaison
officer will also be with me.</p>

of La Boisselle, where the feint attack is
to take place.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour, all the enemy’s
trenches likely to prove of importance to
the raiding party will be brought under
fire. At the same time, the <em>close-range weapons
of the 1st Reserve Company, 13th

<p>On orders received from me personally,

<p>If the enemy opens a barrage on our

either lead the patrol to the enemy’s position
by another route, or cancel the raid.</p>

<p>4. <em>Duty of the patrols.</em>—As many of
the enemy as possible must be made
prisoners; in addition, rifles, machine guns,
rifle grenade stands, trench mortars, etc., as
well as filled packs are to be brought back.
Should it be found impossible to carry back
all the booty owing to the small numbers of
the raiding party, but if, as far as regards
the enemy’s fire it could be done, report will
be passed on to me by Stradtmann’s patrol.</p>

<p>5. <em>Return.</em>—On a signal given by Lieutenant
Stradtmann, or on the “Charge”
being blown by my bugler, the raiding party
will make its way back from the Süd Spion
to the Hohlweg by the shortest way, and
immediately make for the same dug-outs
whence it started. In the dug-outs, I shall
ascertain whether everyone has returned.
Prisoners and booty will be taken into the
dug-outs.</p>

<p>During the raid, if the enemy should open
a heavy barrage on the trenches on the
Schwabenhohe and on the Hohlweg, the
raiding party will remain in the enemy’s
trench and acquaint me of the fact by firing
a red flare. I shall then endeavor to reach
the party and lead them back by some other
way. Should I not arrive, the senior officer
present will lead the entire party.</p>

<p>6. Assistant-Surgeon Wisser will organize
No. 1 Dug-out as a first aid post and
will remain there until the conclusion of the
raid.</p>

<p class="p1">To quote Appendices 2, 3, and 4 would take up too
much space and would add very little to the purpose of the
example. Number 2 consists of a five-page table of the
kinds and time of fire, the batteries of fire, and the targets;
number 3, of detailed orders for a feint attack; and number
4, for a feint bombardment.</p>

<p>The object of the quotation is to show the accuracy and
detail of an operation order. Since the German subject
matter and treatment are about the same as our own, we
ought to gain from it a conception of the requirements of
framing an operation order.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>—The meager space devoted to the Operation
Order in this course of lessons should in no way reflect on
its relative importance among military communications.
Only because the treatment of our own examples is forbidden
and because our experience is slight, do we leave
it without further practice. Those who are armed with
the confidential documents of the War Department may
look into our own operation order more closely; and those
who have conscientiously applied themselves to the work
of the preceding lessons ought to have no trouble with its
composition.</p>


<h3>THE ORDER</h3>

<p>Our Field Service Regulations state<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that “<em>orders</em> in
contra-distinction to field, general, and special orders, are
used by commanders of divisions and separate brigades for
regulating the movements and resupply of the field trains,
fixing the position of distributing points (rations and
forage), authorizing the use of reserve rations, providing
for the refilling of combat trains after combat or a march,
providing for ambulance or hospital service in camps, and
for furnishing such other similar information or instructions
as it is desired to communicate to troops. They also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
include such instructions as may be sent to the commander
of trains, relative to the movements and disposition of the
trains and information with regard to the arrangements
made with the line of communication relative to the positions
of refilling, rendezvous, and evacuation points.”</p>

<p>Thus, when separate orders are necessary for such conditions
as cited, they are called simply <em>orders</em>. They may
be transmitted as field messages between commanders or as
more formal documents. In either case they are usually
addressed to the person concerned.</p>

<p>Examples of <em>orders</em> follow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Have 1st Section, supply, ready to issue at Central
Square in GETTYSBURG at 8 p. m.</p>

<p>Have empty wagons return to LITTLESTOWN tonight

<p>Have the remainder of the ammunition columns halt
beside the road between SAINT MARYS and ALEXANDER
and await orders. Have the field hospitals park
off the road near HILLIS.</p>

<p>On the march, as you overtake, or are joined by, the
field trains of the troops, you will assume command.</p>

</div>


<p>The first two examples are of the formal type. The
third one is less so.</p>

<p><em>Verbal orders</em> are usually transmitted by officers. However,
if the order consists of a single sentence such as, “The
trains will halt two hours at Bingham,” it may be transmitted
by an enlisted man.</p>

<p>Although there is more latitude in the form of written
<em>order</em> than in that of the field order, the one should be as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
brief and unmistakable in its construction as the other.
The paragraph structure and sequence should be as logical
and unified as English composition can make them.</p>

<p>With your book open at the extract from Field Service
Regulations in regard to <em>the order</em>, compose enough imaginary
<em>orders</em> to cover all the instances therein given.</p>


<h3>LETTERS OF INSTRUCTION</h3>

<p><em>Letters of Instruction</em> chiefly differ from orders, operation
orders, and field orders in their lack of definition of
specific tactical duties. They are truly instructions.
They deal mainly with strategic considerations and general
plans, because the writer is usually far away from, or not
in direct command of, the units which are going to carry
out the general plans.</p>

<p>At the beginning of campaigns <em>letters of instruction</em>
enumerate the troops of the various commands and the
corresponding leaders.</p>

<p>“In armies, combat orders will often be in the form of,
or a part of, letters of instruction to the commanding
generals in the field armies composing the army. But
where the field armies are within supporting distance of
each other and can mutually coöperate in the task assigned
them, formal combat orders may be issued. Such orders
are necessarily general in character and consist of a statement
of the objective sought by the army commander, and
of the part he expects each field army to play in attaining
this objective. The army commander, either by means of
letters of instruction or by personal conferences with his
field army commanders, fully acquaints them not only with
the immediate end in view, but also with so much of his
future plans as may be necessary to insure thorough cooperation
on their part.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>


<p>In the illustration which follows, President Lincoln outlines
a general offensive to the various armies. As commander-in-chief
he issues the substance of a letter of
instructions in the form of an executive order. In it we
shall notice that he does not prescribe any specific movement
of troops.</p>

From Washington, 24th.<br>
</p>

<div class="fs90">Maj.-Gen. G. B. McClellan,—</div>

<p>I left General McDowell’s camp at dark last evening.
Shield’s command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot
move before Monday morning, the twenty-sixth (26th).
We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places,
that it was broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable
loss to us of one (1) regiment infantry, two (2) companies
cavalry, putting General Banks in some peril.</p>

<p>The enemy’s forces under General Anderson, now opposing
General McDowell’s advance, have as their line of
supply and retreat the road to Richmond.</p>

<p>If, in conjunction with McDowell’s movement against
Anderson, you could send a force from your right to cut
off the enemy’s supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad
bridges across the two (2) forks of the Pamunkey,
and intercept the enemy’s retreat, you will prevent the
army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of
numbers of nearly fifteen thousand (15,000) men, and if
you succeed in saving the bridges, you will secure a line of
railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have.
Can you not do this almost as well as not, while you are
building the Chickahominy bridges? McDowell and
Shields both say you can, and positively will, move Monday
morning. I wish you to march cautiously and safely.</p>

<p>You will have command of McDowell after he joins you,
precisely as you indicated in your long dispatch to us of
the twenty-first (21st).</p>

the one to make the decision.</p>

<p>To progress in our examples, let us take one issued by
the general-in-chief to one of his subordinate generals.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">Headquarters of the Army,</span><br>

<div class="fs90">
Maj.-Gen. B. F. Butler,<br>
<span class="pad2">U. S. Volunteers,—</span></div>

<p><em>General</em>:—You are assigned to the command of the land
forces destined to coöperate with the navy, in the attack
upon New Orleans. You will use every means to keep your
destination a profound secret, even from your staff officers,
with the exception of your chief-of-staff, and Lieut.
Weitzel, of the engineers. The force at your disposal will
consist of the first 13 regiments named in your memorandum
handed to me in person, the 21st Indiana, 4th Wisconsin,
and 6th Michigan (old and good regiments from
Baltimore).</p>

<p>The 21st Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and the 6th Michigan,
will await your orders at Fort Monroe.</p>

<p>Two companies of the 21st Indiana, are well-drilled as
heavy artillery. The cavalry force already en route for
Ship Island, will be sufficient for your purposes.</p>

<p>After full consultation with officers well acquainted with
the country in which it is proposed to operate, I have
arrived at the conclusion that (2) two light batteries fully
equipped and (1) one without horses, will be all that are
necessary.</p>

<p>This will make your force about 14,400 infantry, 275
cavalry, 680 artillery; total 15,255 men.</p>

<p>The commanding general of the Department of Key
West, is authorized to loan you, temporarily, 2 regiments;
Fort Pickens can probably give you another, which will
bring your force to nearly 18,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>The object of your expedition is one of vital importance,
the capture of New Orleans. The route selected is
up the Mississippi River, and the first obstacle to be
encountered (perhaps the only one) is in the resistance
of Forts St. Philip and Jackson. It is expected that the
navy can reduce these works; in that case, you will, after
their capture, leave a sufficient garrison in them to render
them perfectly secure; and it is recommended, that on the
upward passage, a few heavy guns, and some troops, be
left at Pilot Station (at the forks of the river), to cover
a retreat in the event of disaster. These troops and guns,
will, of course, be removed as soon as the forts are captured.</p>

<p>Should the navy fail to reduce the works, you will land
your forces and siege train, and endeavor to breach the
works, silence their fire, and carry them by assault.</p>

<p>The next resistance will be near the English Bend, where
there are some earthen batteries; here it may be necessary
for you to land your troops and coöperate with the naval
attack, although it is more than probable, that the navy,
unassisted, can accomplish the result. If these works are
taken, the city of New Orleans necessarily falls. In that
event, it will probably be best to occupy Algiers with the
mass of your troops, also, the eastern bank of the river
above the city; it may be necessary to place some troops in
the city to preserve order, but if there appears sufficient
Union sentiment to control the city, it may be best for
purposes of discipline to keep your men out of the city.</p>

<p>After obtaining possession of New Orleans, it will be
necessary to reduce all the works guarding its approaches
from the east, and particularly to gain the Manchac Pass.
Baton Rouge, Berwick Bay, and Fort Livingston will next
claim your attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>A feint at Galveston may facilitate the objects we have
in view. I need not call your attention to the necessity of
gaining possession of all the rolling stock you can on the
different railways, and of obtaining control of the roads
themselves. The occupation of Baton Rouge by a combined
naval and land force, should be accomplished as soon
as possible after you have gained New Orleans. Then
endeavor to open your communication with the northern
column by the Mississippi, always bearing in mind the
necessity of occupying Jackson, Mississippi, as soon as
you can safely do so, either after, or before you have
effected the junction. Allow nothing to divert you from
obtaining possession of all the approaches to New Orleans.
When that object is accomplished to its fullest extent, it
will be necessary to make a combined attack on Mobile, in
order to gain possession of the harbor and works, as well
as to control the railway terminus at the city.</p>

<p>In regard to this, I will send more detailed instructions
as the operations of the northern column develop themselves.</p>

<p>I may briefly state that the general objects of the expedition
are: <em>First</em>, The reduction of New Orleans and all its
approaches: then Mobile and its defenses: then Pensacola,
Galveston, etc. It is probable that by the time New
Orleans has been reduced it will be in the power of the
government to reinforce the land forces sufficiently to
accomplish all these objects; in the meantime you will
please give all the assistance in your power to the army
and navy commanders in your vicinity, never losing sight
of the fact, that the great object to be achieved is the
capture and firm retention of New Orleans.</p>

<p>General McClellan goes more into detail than does the
President. He is considering the situation on more technical
lines. Yet he does not go beyond the limits of
strategy in outlining the general plan. He still conforms
to the principles of letters of instruction. If we were to
follow General Butler in his journey to the Gulf, we should
perceive in his orders the disappearance of the strategic
and the appearance of the tactical idea. Later we should
discover one of his brigade commanders actually issuing a
field order.</p>

<p>Notice in the last example how, on account of its length,
General McClellan has made a neat summary of the whole.
Notice that in all of these letters the writers have adhered
to the principles of rhetoric; and that they have given to
the recipient a unified and coherent production. Why?
Because the will of the commander is transmitted more
quickly in that way.</p>

<p>We have now completed the consideration of the expression
which directly affects troops in the field. We have
written the <em>field message</em> which brings information to commanders
and which helps them to make an estimate of a
situation. We have framed the <em>field order</em> which grows
out of that estimate and which transforms the decision into
action. We have viewed the <em>operation order</em> which is no
more than a field order made to fit trench warfare. We
have seen <em>orders</em> which are issued in connection with combat
so as to govern the movement of trains. We have
read letters of <em>instruction</em> which are written by higher commanders
in order to regulate in a general way extensive
movements. All of these communications bear specifically
upon the effort of troops toward success in battle—the
ultimate object of all military training.</p>

<p>In leaving this most important part of our professional
work, we might take with us this one idea. We can best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
express ourselves in any of the communications we have
studied by having all the thoughts of one kind together
and the different kinds in an orderly arrangement. Whenever
it is possible we should keep the paragraph sequence,</p>

<span class="fs90">THE WAR DIARY—THE REPORT—ROUTINE ORDERS</span></h2>


<p>We have heretofore considered those communications
which aid combat. We now take up those which have no
direct bearing upon the outcome of an engagement. We
have seen how the <em>field message</em> makes possible by its fresh
information the plan for battle, how the <em>field</em> and <em>operation
orders</em> frame that plan for battle, how the <em>order</em> maneuvers
the trains in connection with battle, and how <em>letters</em>
of <em>instruction</em> issue general directions for a campaign of
many battles. We now come to the place where the
maneuver, enterprise, or undertaking is over. For a
variety of future benefits we must have a record of those
occurrences. The <em>War Diary</em> and <em>The Report</em> are the
communications which perform that office.</p>


<h3>THE WAR DIARY</h3>

<p>Just as certain individuals keep journals of their lives,
so the higher military units keep diaries of their existences.
“The War Diary is a record of events kept in campaign
by each battalion and higher organization and by each
ammunition, supply, engineer, and sanitary train. Entries
are made daily and should form a concise history of the
military operations. A day comprises 24 hours covered</p>


<p>Each day’s record will commence with a march table, or
statement of the operations or location of the organization,
including an account of weather, roads, camp, health
of troops, etc., and a statement of the supply of ammunition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
rations, and forage. This will be followed by a
chronological record of events, including time and place of
issue and receipt of orders and messages, with a copy or a
synopsis of contents.</p>

<p>It is of especial importance that the exact hour and
place at which movements are begun and ended, and orders
or important messages sent or received be noted. After
an engagement, the war diary will contain a report of
losses and captures and will be accompanied by a sketch
showing the positions of the command at the most important
phases.</p>

<p>Each day’s record will be attested by the commander
or by the adjutant; and, with attached copies of orders

<p>The date in this case would cover the whole period from

<h3>REPORTS</h3>

<p>Reports cover a wide range of subjects. When a leader
is in doubt as to whether an event is important enough to
report, he had better take the wise course and send in his
description of what has happened. Very few occurrences
in the military service are so unessential as to be rightfully
ignored.</p>

<p>They may take either one of two forms: either they may
be dated, headed “Report on so-and-so” (see example on
following), and inclosed with a letter of transmittal; or
they may themselves be in the form of letters addressed
directly to the person or office for whom they are destined.</p>

<p>Reports may consist of expository description on the
one hand or of a narration on the other, but they usually
consist of a combination of the two.</p>

<p>Here is an example of highly expository description.
It is the report upon the German raid which was given us
under <em>Operation Orders</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
In the field, 12th April, 1916.<br>
</p>

<p class="center smcap">Captain Wagener’s Report on the Raid on the Evening<br>of 11th
April, 1916</p>

<p>At 4 p. m. the raiding party marched from Martinpuich through
Pozières, then by the Lattorf Graben—Regimentstrichter—Krebs
Graben to the Appointed dug-outs on the left of Sap No. 3, where
the evening meal was found ready prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>At 8 p. m. the artillery preparation commenced as prearranged.
Shortly after fire was opened, the whole of the enemy’s position from
Windmühle to Besenhecke was wrapped in greyish-white smoke, which
the wind drove back over Sap No. 3 into our lines.</p>

<p>By 8.10 p. m. it was impossible to remain in our trench east of
Sap No. 3 without wearing a gas mask. This was still the case at
8.20 p. m., when the patrols moved forward from their dug-outs to
the Hohlweg, in the order Stradtmann, Dumas, Böhlefeld, and
Freund. Lieutenant Boenig followed close behind Lieutenant Stradtmann.</p>

<p>By 8.25 p. m. the party was posted ready in the Hohlweg. The
clouds of gas and smoke, however, still hung so thick over the enemy’s
trenches that it was impossible to distinguish whether our own shells
were still falling on the point of entry or whether our artillery had
already lengthened their range.</p>

<p>At 8.27 p. m. Lieutenant Stradtmann received the order to advance
to the attack with his patrol. Lieutenant Boenig, with the six
stretcher bearers, left the Hohlweg simultaneously and in rear of
Stradtmann’s patrol, and posted connecting files, whose positions
were marked by red signal lamps shaded to the front and to the sides.</p>

<p>At 8.28 p. m. Dumas’ and Böhlefeld’s patrols advanced. Following
the line of connecting files, they reached the point of entry, to find
that Stradtmann’s patrol was already in possession of 16 yards of
trench, and had captured three prisoners. The latter had come out of
their dug-outs just as Lieutenant Stradtmann appeared in front of
the enemy’s trench. They carried hand grenades and rifles with
bayonets fixed, but were immediately disarmed by Lieutenants
Boenig and Stradtmann.</p>

<p>Dumas’ patrol immediately turned to the left down the trench,
and, in a few steps, came upon a half-destroyed machine gun emplacement.
Reservist Nadolny, of Stradtmann’s patrol, was already
occupied in digging out the buried machine gun. Lieutenant Dumas
penetrated further along the enemy’s trench, and soon reached the
communication trench which runs, roughly along the dividing line
between Target Sectors 79 and 80, towards the Weisse Steinmauer.
At this point a large dug-out had been wrecked, apparently by a
direct hit. Lieutenant Dumas had previously sent three men of his
patrol along behind the enemy’s trench; they reached the communication
trench about 11 yards behind the front line trench. A
few Englishmen, who came out of this communication trench, endeavored
to reach the parados of the front line trench, whence they
evidently intended to defend it. They were, however, surprised by our
three men and bayoneted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Dumas, with the rest of his men, forced his
way further along the trench, and just north of Besenhecke reached
the communication trench which leads to the brown prolongation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the Weisse Steinmauer (white stone wall). They passed another
wrecked dug-out, in which dead bodies were seen. Adjoining the
above-mentioned communication trench, another large dug-out was
found, which the patrol intended to clear. As, however, a number
of Englishmen advanced upon Dumas’ patrol from the communication
trench and alongside it, a mêlée ensued with grenades, rifles and
pistols, in the course of which the enemy, after suffering evident loss,
either retreated or surrendered, while none of Dumas’ patrol received
wounds of any account.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Böhlefeld advanced along the enemy’s
trench to the right of the point of entry, and, in a few yards, came
to three large dug-outs, of which one was wrecked and full of dead
and wounded. At his summons, the enemy came out of the others
and surrendered without more ado. Lieutenant Böhlefeld sent back
the prisoners and asked for reinforcements in order to clear the dug-outs,
undertaking, meanwhile, to hold the enemy’s trench with two
men.</p>

<p>At 8.30 p. m., as no noise came from the point of entry, or from
the right of the same, while from a point some 65 yards to the left
shots and reports of grenades could be heard, I ordered Vice-Sergeant
Major Elb to advance with five men and reinforce Dumas’ patrol.
Lieutenant Erb, the regimental adjutant, attached himself to this
party. He was wearing an oxygen-breathing apparatus and had been
waiting in the Hohlweg. Shortly after, the sounds of fighting ceased
on the left, and the first batch of prisoners was brought back from
the enemy’s trench. I had come to the conclusion that we had the
upper hand everywhere, especially on the right, and with a view to
exploiting fully our success, I ordered Lieutenant Freund to cross the
enemy’s trench at the point of entry with 15 men of the supports,
and to attack the Spion from the rear. At the same time, I sent forward
Vice-Sergeant Major Wölfle with 4 men to reinforce Lieutenant
Böhlefeld.</p>

<p>In order to have a reserve in hand for meeting all eventualities, I
ordered up the commanders of the two groups on the flank of the 12th
Company, which was stationed immediately to the right of Sap No. 3.
The groups had been warned in the afternoon and given the necessary
instructions. Whilst Vice-Sergeant Majors Elb and Wölfle, with their
men, went in search of Dumas’ and Böhlefeld’s patrols, Lieutenant
Freund dashed across the enemy’s trench at the point of entry and
followed it along to the right as far as the communication trench
which leads into the front line trench near the Spion. Freund’s patrol
leapt into the enemy’s front line trench on both sides of the communication
trench, captured 10 men almost without a struggle, and
secured several rifles and articles of equipment. A few Englishmen
who offered resistance were bayoneted; Volunteer Herrmann, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
7th Company, and Lance Corporal Haufler, of the 4th Company, particularly
distinguished themselves. A few Englishmen attempted to
get away, but were shot dead.</p>

<p>Volunteer Herrmann further discovered an extemporized trench
mortar. The latter could not be carried off, however, as it was securely
built in. Vice-Sergeant Major Wölfle, who arrived on the scene
shortly after, destroyed the trench mortar as well as he could with
hand grenades and pistol shots.</p>

<p>Böhlefeld’s reinforced patrol had accompanied the advance of
Freund’s patrol along the trench, and came across three or four
more wrecked dug-outs, which were filled with dead. Individuals
standing about in the trench were killed by the patrol or made
prisoner. During this affair, Under Officer Nössler, of the 11th
Company, repeatedly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>Whilst our party was breaking into the enemy’s trenches or
perhaps even before, a party of the enemy, approximately 25 to 30
strong, succeeded in getting away from the front line trench and
making their way back to the Weisse Steinmauer, but were again
driven back by our artillery fire, and now came running towards
Stradtmann’s patrol. The latter, apprehending a counter-attack,
opened fire. Ersatz Reservist Walzer, of the 11th Company, followed
by Under Officer Staiger, of the 10th Company and others, raised a
cheer and charged the Englishmen, bayoneting two of them. Those
who did not put up their hands and surrender, were killed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Erb had soon caught up Dumas’ patrol and took part
in the subsequent fighting, which was practically continuous, for
almost every one of the enemy offered resistance. With hand grenade
and pistol, Dumas’ patrol killed more than 20 of the enemy, besides
wounding a large number. In this fighting Volunteer Hees, of the
6th Company, particularly distinguished himself. Always to the
fore, he alone accounted for several Englishmen. On our side only
one man was slightly wounded.</p>

<p>In consequence of the events described above, Dumas’ patrol
remained in the enemy’s trench considerably longer than intended.
When all the other patrols had returned to the Hohlweg, the Dumas-Erb
patrol was still missing.</p>

<p>Hereupon, Lieutenants Boenig and Stradtmann, with several non-commissioned
officers and men, went back to the enemy’s lines and
searched the trench to the left until they met the Dumas-Erb patrol
on its way back. Here again Under Officer Nössler, of the 11th
Company, 110th Reserve Infantry Regiment, distinguished himself.</p>

<p>At 8.50 p. m., the last men of the entire party had returned to the
Hohlweg and went back to their dug-outs.</p>

<p>At 8.51 p. m., the first shell fell on the front line trenches east of
Sap No. 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>At 8.57 p. m., the artillery commander was informed that the
artillery fire could be gradually broken off.</p>

<p>At 9 p. m., a heavy battery near Albert dropped a few shells
near Sap No. 3.</p>

<p>At 9.05 p. m., the conclusion of the operation was reported.</p>

<p>The following were captured: 24 unwounded and 5 wounded
prisoners, 1 Lewis gun, 1 rifle with telescopic sights, 20 ordinary
rifles, and a large number of steel helmets, belts with ammunition
pouches, packs, haversacks, and gas helmets.</p>

<p>Our casualties consisted of one man slightly wounded in the forehead
by a splinter from a hand grenade. He was bandaged in the
advanced dressing-station and immediately returned to the patrol.</p>

<p class="pad30pc">40 copies, as appendices to the Report of the
110th Reserve Infantry Regiment on the raid of
the 11th April, 1916.</p>
</div>


<p class="p1">A more narrative form of report is represented by the
following extract from Gen. Bragg’s report during the
Civil War:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To meet our successful advance and retrieve his losses in the front
of his left, the enemy early transferred a portion of his reserve from
his left to that flank, and by 2 o’clock had succeeded in concentrating
such a force on Lieutenant General Hardee’s front as to check his
further progress. Our two lines had, by this time, become almost
blended, so weak were they by losses, exhaustion, and extension to
cover the enemy’s whole front. As early as 10 a. m. Major General
Breckinridge was called on for one brigade, and soon after for a
second, to reinforce or act as a reserve to General Hardee. His
reply to the first call represented the enemy as crossing Stone’s River
in heavy force in his immediate front; and on receiving the second
order he informed me they had already crossed in heavy force and
were advancing on him in two lines. He was immediately ordered not
to wait attack but to advance and meet them. About this same time
a report reached me that a heavy force of the enemy’s infantry was
advancing on the Lebanon Road about five miles in Breckinridge’s
front. Brigadier General Pegram, who had been sent to that road
to cover the flank of the infantry with the cavalry brigade (save two
regiments, detached with Wheeler and Wharton), was ordered forward
immediately to develop such movement. The orders for the
two brigades from Breckinridge were countermanded, whilst dispositions
were made at his request to reinforce him. Before they
could be carried out, the movements ordered disclosed the facts that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
no force had crossed Stone’s River; that the only enemy in our immediate
front there was a small body of sharpshooters, and that
there was no advance on the Lebanon Road.</p>

<p>“These unfortunate misapprehensions on that part of the field
(which, with proper precaution, could not have existed) withheld
from active operation three fine brigades until the enemy had succeeded
in checking our progress, had reëstablished his lines, and had
collected many of his broken battalions.”</p>
</div>


<p class="p1">The above example, in addition to its value as a narrative
report, illustrates the dependence of a commander
upon proper information.</p>


<h3>ROUTINE ORDERS</h3>

<p>Routine Orders preserve their normal tenor in peace or
war. They have to do with the administration of the
military service, so that a state of campaign has very little
influence upon their character.</p>

<p><em>General Orders</em> “include generally, (1) all detailed
instructions necessary in carrying out certain general
regulations or orders issued from superior headquarters;
(2) all standing instructions, to the end that frequent
repetitions may be avoided; and (3) proceedings of general
and special courts-martial.”</p>

<p>General Orders are issued by commanders of armies,
field armies, corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, separate
battalions, posts, departments, and districts.</p>

<p>“When necessary, <em>orders</em> are used by commanders of
battalions forming parts of regiments, and for smaller
units and detachments, for the same class of instructions
as are promulgated by higher commanders in general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
orders.” In other words <em>orders</em> is a term used to designate
those instructions issued by commanders of divisions and of
separate brigades in regard to trains, and also a term used
by battalions and smaller units to designate those instructions
corresponding to general orders for higher units.</p>

Department.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">Madison Barracks, N. Y.,</span><br>

<p>

&#160;&#160; To: <span class="pad2">The Adjutant General of the Army</span><br>
<span class="pad5">(Through C. O. Madison Barracks, N. Y.)</span><br>
&#160;&#160; Subject: Request for leave of absence.</p>
</div>

<p>The heading consists of the name of the office, place, and
date. In the first example the name of the office was
“Headquarters, Eastern Department.” In the second,
“Company A, 99th Infantry.” In the third, there was no
office named because the letter was written by an officer as
an individual and not as an executive of an organization.
The place is the post-office address of an officer’s station in
any case. “Indefinite expressions of locality, which do
not indicate where the letter was written,”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> should never
be used. The date is written on the same line as the place,
except where no office is designated; and it is written <em>not</em>
as in communications dealing with combat, but in the
ordinary way.</p>

<p>The “From” in the <em>From Whom Sent</em> begins one line (if
typed, two lines) below the heading and at the left-hand
margin. It is followed by the official designation of the
writer, or in the absence of any official designation, the
name of writer with his rank and regiment, corps, or
department. The rank is written before the name; and
the regiment, corps, or department after the name.</p>

<p>Directly below the “From” is placed the “To” in <em>To
Whom Sent</em>, followed by the official designation or name
of the person addressed. What follows “To” is written
in the same manner as what follows “From.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>Directly below the “To” comes the word “Subject”
which is followed by an expression which will give the gist
of the <em>Body</em> of the letter. This expression will be boiled
to a minimum and will not exceed ten words.</p>

<p>The words “From,” “To,” and “Subject” will be immediately
followed by colons, and the “F,” “T,” and “S” will
be on the same vertical line.</p>

<p>The <em>Body</em> of the letter will comprise one subject only.
A leave of absence and a decision, for instance, will not be
requested in the same letter. Two separate communications
will be written. This procedure is merely that of
carrying out the principle of unity in the whole composition.
A violation in this regard causes endless worry to
the receiving office and a deserved rebuke for the writer.</p>

<p>When typewritten, the body of the letter will be single-spaced.
Double spaces will be used between paragraphs.
The body should begin on the second fold of the paper.</p>

<p>The paragraphs will be numbered, will each contain <em>one</em>
topic, and will be arranged in a logical sequence of topics.</p>

<p>Thus if we were to write out the <em>Body</em> of the letter for
the last illustration of the <em>Brief</em>, we should have it appear
about as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1.—I request a leave of absence for five months to take
effect on or about February 1, 1940.</p>

<p>2.—My reasons for this request are very urgent at this
time. I have had ten years of continuous service without
a leave of any kind, and I feel the need of more than an
ordinary rest. Besides, my private affairs are in such
shape that the matter of straightening them out will
require at least all of the period requested.</p>

<p>3.—My address while on leave will be care of Astor
Hotel, New York City.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>The Ending</em></p>

<p>
<span class="pad5">{ The Signature.</span><br>
&#160; &#160; consists of &#160; { The Rank.<br>
<span class="pad6">{ The Regiment, Corps, or Department.</span></p>

<p>“Official communications will be signed or authenticated
with the pen and not by facsimiles, and if written by order,
it will be stated by whose order. Signatures will be
plainly and legibly written. By virtue of the commission
and assignment to duty, the adjutant of any command
transacts the business or correspondence of that command
over his signature; but when orders or instructions of any
kind are given, the authority by which he gives the order
must be stated.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“The <em>Body</em> of the letter will be followed by the <em>Signature</em>.
If the <em>Rank</em> and the <em>Regiment</em>, <em>Corps</em> or <em>Department</em>
of the writer appear at the beginning of the letter,
they will not appear after his name; but if they do not
appear at the beginning of the letter, they will follow under
his name.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>To illustrate fully what we have said, let us write the
<em>Body</em> and <em>Ending</em> of the first illustration of the <em>Brief</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Department Commander directs that you submit
without delay the report of your recent inspection of the
Organized Militia of the State of New York, and that you
also submit an explanation of your failure to comply with
par. 6, S. O. 25, c. s., these headquarters.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">J. L. Thurst,</span><br>
Lieut. Col., 24th Cav.</p>
</div>

<p>One-half inch below the Ending of the letter comes the
first of the <em>Indorsements</em>, and the succeeding <em>Indorsements</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
follow one another serially, with a space of about one-half
inch between <em>Indorsements</em>.</p>

<p>Letters in the military service are not answered in the
sense in which we use the term in civilian life. In other
words, the person who receives a letter does not retain it
and reply thereto by another. Instead he states what he
has to say in an <em>Indorsement</em>, which is put down in continuation
of the original letter. Thus everything which
has been written in regard to the contents of a letter appears
as a part of the letter when it is finally filed.</p>

<p>When Captain Douglas’ request for leave of absence,
for example, reaches the headquarters of his regiment, it
has added to it the Colonel’s indorsement which appears
as follows, provided the Colonel wishes the Captain to obtain
the leave:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pad40pc">1st Ind.</span><br>
Hq. 99th Inf., Madison Barracks, N. Y., Jan. 11, 1940—<br>

<p>Approved recommended.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">E. F. Hush,</span><br>
Colonel, 99th Inf., Comdg.</p>
</div>

<p>The serial number of indorsements, the place, the date,
and to whom written, will be written as shown above. When
typewritten, they will be written single-spaced, with a
double space between paragraphs.</p>

<p>Should one or more additional sheets be necessary for
the <em>Body</em> or <em>Indorsements</em>, sheets of the same size as the
first will be added. Only one side of the paper will be used
for writing.</p>

<p>Indorsements of a routine nature such as referring,
transmitting, forwarding, and returning papers, will not
be signed with the full name, but with initials.</p>

<p>When the letter of the Department Commander to Captain
Douglas reaches the Commanding Officer, Madison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Barracks, N. Y., who is also Commanding Officer, 99th Infantry,
the latter may do either of two things. He may
simply forward the letter to Captain Douglas without comment,
because he deems the letter sufficient for the purpose;
or he may add a disciplinary word also.</p>

<p>In the first case the indorsement would appear as follows:</p>

Hq. 99th Inf., Madison Barracks, N. Y., May 23, 1940—<br>
To Captain James L. Douglas, 99th Inf., Forwarded,<br>
A. D. T.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">In the second case the indorsement would appear as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pad40pc">1st Ind.</span><br>
Hq. 99th Inf., Madison Bks., N. Y., May 23, 1940—<br>
To Captain James L. Douglas, 99th Inf.</p>

<p>For compliance.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">By order of Colonel Maish,</span><br>
<span class="padr4">A. D. Thomas,</span><br>
<span class="padr2">Capt. 99th Inf.,</span><br>
Adjutant.</p>
</div>


<p class="p1">The <em>Body</em> and <em>Indorsements</em> of letters are signed by the
Adjutant when the letters are addressed to those lower in
rank than the Commanding Officer. They are signed by
the Commanding Officer himself when addressed to those
higher in rank than the Commanding Officer. Letters are
never addressed to adjutants.</p>

<p>In connection with indorsements it might be well to
quote what Army Regulations say in their regard.</p>

<p>“Communications, whether from a subordinate to a
superior, or vice versa, will pass through intermediate
commanders. This rule will not be interpreted as including
matters in relation to which intermediate commanders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
can have no knowledge, and over which they are not expected
to exercise control. Chiefs of War Department
bureaus are intermediate commanders between higher
authority and the officers and enlisted men of their respective
corps or departments, who are serving under the exclusive
control of themselves and their subordinates. Verbal
communications will be governed by the same rules as
to channels as written communications. When necessity
requires communications to be sent through other than the
prescribed channel, the necessity therefor will be stated.</p>

<p>Communications from superiors to subordinates will be
answered through the same channels as received.</p>

<p>Except as provided above, all communications, reports,
and estimates from officers serving at a military post, and
communications of every nature addressed to them relating
to affairs of the post, will pass through the post commander.</p>

<p>Officers who forward communications will indorse thereon
their approval or disapproval, with remarks. No communication
will be forwarded to the War Department by a
department commander or other superior officer for the
action of the Secretary of War without some recommendations
or expression of opinion.”</p>

<p>It may often be necessary to enclose other letters, certain
documents, or even bulkier material with a letter.
Such addition to a letter is called an <em>Inclosure</em> and is submitted
as part of the letter. <em>Inclosures</em> to the original
communication will be noted on the face of the letter at the
left-hand margin opposite the signature, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2 Incls.</p>
<p class="rt">J. L. Douglas, &#160; &#160;<br>
Capt. 99th Inf.</p>
</div>

<p>The inclosures themselves will be numbered on the outside.
The two inclosures of the above example would be
marked 1 and 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>If others are added when an indorsement is made, their
number will be noted at the foot of the indorsement and
upon themselves, as just described for the original communication.</p>

<p>If few in number or not bulky, inclosures may be kept
inside the original paper; otherwise they should be folded
together in a wrapper marked “Inclosures.” If kept within
the paper they lie between folds <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> below.</p>

<p>Now that we have discussed in order the different
parts of an official letter to a person in the military service,
let us see how the various parts appear when assembled.</p>

<p class="p2">The dotted lines on page 1 of the model represent the
creases between the folds <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. <em>a</em> contains the <em>Brief</em>
in the relative position shown and is folded away from <em>b</em>,
the crease between the two being toward the reader. <em>b</em>
begins the <em>Body</em> and may contain it or only a part of it
according to its length. <em>c</em> contains the continuation of the
Body or the whole or parts of indorsements, as the case
may be. <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> are folded toward each other, the crease
between the two being away from the reader.</p>

<p>Page 2 contains the body or indorsements of the letter.
All pages are folded as page 1 in three equal folds.</p>

<p>When foolscap is used instead of the ordinary sized
letter paper as above, the only difference is that there is
an extra fold. Imagine this fold to be tacked on to the
bottom of page 1 in the example and to be marked <em>d</em>. <em>d</em>
and <em>c</em> would be folded just as <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. The page would
contain a third crease and be a fold longer. Otherwise the
letter would be the same as the first one described.</p>

<p>The number at the upper left-hand corner is the filing
number of the office.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in the seventh indorsement that three
inclosures have been added. The whole transaction is
noted in the proper place. The eleventh and twelfth indorsements
should be noticed in the same regard.</p>

<p>Where “stamp” appears in parenthesis, the word does
not actually occur in letters. It indicates that the office
which received the letter noted by means of a rubber stamp
at that particular place on the letter the date on which
the communication was received or received back. In other
words, what follows “(Stamp)” was placed there by some
one of the office force as soon as the letter was received
in that office.</p>

<p>The writing on all pages should begin one inch from the
top. The pages, beginning with the first will be numbered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
serially. The number will be placed half way between the
edges and one inch above the bottom of the page. In referring
to an indorsement by number, the number of the page
will also be given, thus: “5th Ind., page 3.”</p>

<p>All ceremonial forms at the beginning and end of letters
such as “Sir,” “I have the honor,” “I would respectfully,”
“Very respectfully” and the like will be omitted.
In referring, transmitting, forwarding, and returning
papers, the expressions “Respectfully referred,” “Respectfully
transmitted,” “Respectfully forwarded,” and
“Respectfully returned,” will also be omitted.</p>

<p>“An officer will not be designated in orders nor addressed
in official communications by any other title than that of
his actual rank.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Wherever appropriate the name should
be supplanted by the title, such as “Commanding Officer,
Co. A, 99th Infantry” in place of “Captain James L.
Douglas.”</p>

<p>“All letters and indorsements which are typewritten,
excepting letters of transmittal, reports of taking leave
of absence, periodical reports, and communications of a
similar nature, will be made with two carbon copies. One
copy will be retained for the records of the office in which
the letter was written, and the other will be forwarded
with the communication for the files of the first office in
which a complete copy is required for the records, but such
copy will not be regarded as an enclosure. It will be initialed
by the person responsible for the communication.”</p>

<p>“In official correspondence between officers or between
officers and officials of other branches of the public service,
and especially in matters involving questions of jurisdiction,
conflict of authority, or dispute, officers of the Army
are reminded that their correspondence should be courteous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
in tone and free from any expression partaking of a
personal nature or calculated to give offense. Whenever
questions of such character shall arise between officers and
officials of other branches of the public service, and it is
found that they cannot be reconciled by an interchange of
courteous correspondence, the officer of the Army, as the
representative of the interests of the War Department in
the matter involved, will make a full presentation of the
case to the Secretary of War through the proper military
channels, in order that the same may be properly considered.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the possibility of confidential communications
falling into the hands of persons other than
those for whom they are intended, the sender will enclose
them in an inner and outer cover; the inner cover to be a
sealed envelope or wrapper addressed in the usual way,
but marked plainly “Confidential” in such a manner that
the notation may be most readily seen when the outer cover
is removed. The package thus prepared will then be enclosed
in another sealed envelope or wrapper addressed in
the ordinary manner with no notation to indicate the confidential
nature of the contents.</p>

<p>The foregoing applies not only to confidential communications
entrusted to the mails or to telegraph companies,
but also to such communications entrusted to messengers
passing between different offices of the same headquarters,
including the bureaus and offices of the War Department.”</p>


<p class="p1">We have so far discussed in this chapter official letters
to persons in the military service. We now come to consider
the second form of official letter—the one to persons
outside the military service. Often an adjutant or quartermaster
is called upon to write to individuals or firms not
conversant with the military forms. For a variety of reasons,
the business form in that case is best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>In general the two forms present the following differences
and likenesses. The headings are the same. The
business form substitutes the <em>Address</em> of the <em>Recipient</em> and
the <em>Salutation</em> for the <em>From Whom Sent</em>, <em>To Whom Sent</em>,
and <em>Subject</em> of the military form. The <em>Body</em> in each case
follows the principles of paragraphing, and unity and coherence
of the whole, as set down for the military form. In
the business form the paragraphs need not be numbered.
The business form has a complimentary close before the
signature, rank, and organization of the writer. Letters
are retained by the recipient and answered by him with a
new letter, the sender retaining a carbon copy. Indorsements
are not used in the business form.</p>

<p>An example of a good business form appears below.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span class="padr4">Office of the Quartermaster,</span><br>
<span class="padr2">West Point, N. Y.,</span><br>
August 7, 1930.</p>

<p>Messrs. D. C. Johnson and Company,<br>
&#160; &#160; 312 High Street,<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>In reference to your letter of the 5th inst., I desire to
inform you that there is no need here at present for the
roofing mentioned.</p>

<p>I regret that we cannot at this time become customers
of your firm, but we shall hold you in mind when the necessity
for roofing arises.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">Yours very truly,</span><br>
<span class="padr4">J. H. Smith,</span><br>
<span class="padr2">Major, Q. M. Corps, U. S. A.</span><br>
Quartermaster.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">The entire <em>address</em> of the recipient had best be written
before the <em>salutation</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>Other proper <em>salutations</em> are:</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
My dear Sir:<br>
My dear Madam:<br>
Ladies:</p>

<p>Other proper <em>Complimentary Closings</em> are:</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
Yours truly,<br>
<ins class="corr" id="tn-181" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Your respectfully,'">
Yours respectfully,</ins></p>

<p>Stick close to the forms of the model above. A very
slight departure will make you appear crude. For instance,
to say</p>

<p>
D. C. Johnson,<br>
<span class="pad2">Boston, Mass.</span><br>
<span class="pad2">Messrs.—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">would be entirely wrong.</p>

<p>As to the <em>Body</em> of the letter, however, write it your own
way so long as you use words, phrases, clauses, sentences,
and paragraphs, of a kind we have striven to attain
throughout this work. Do not make your letter telegraphic;
complete your sentences.</p>

<p>The instructions given for the attainment of the proper
forms in ordinary business communications are in no sense
as rigid as those given for the military communication.
Many officers now use the military forms for their correspondence
with business firms, and, indeed, many of these
firms have themselves adopted the military form.</p>

<p>The third type of official letter is that of the official
telegram. It does not differ in principle from the ordinary
telegram, and therefore does not require separate practice.
Those who have conquered the field message should have no
trouble in its composition.</p>

<p>It is written on an official telegraph blank which may
be obtained from the Quartermaster. The blank is for
the purpose of having the message go at Government expense.
Army Regulations state that “telegrams will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
followed by official copies sent by the first mail in cases
of financial transactions of more than trifling importance,
and in cases in which chiefs of bureaus of the War Department
may deem it necessary themselves to send, or to
require officers serving under their immediate control to
send them, such copies.” It is a good thing in any case
to mail a copy of a telegram.</p>

<p>The other kinds of official correspondence which need no
letters to accompany them are <em>Rolls</em>, <em>Returns</em>, <em>Estimates</em>,
<em>Requisitions</em>, and <em>Routine Reports</em>. A study of these forms
of communication belongs properly to the subject of administration.
They are, therefore, simply mentioned here.</p>

<p>The principal Rolls with which the novice in the military
service is confronted are the <em>Muster</em> and <em>Pay Rolls</em>.
The former is rendered every two months and the latter
every month.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Full instructions as to what is required
in each set of rolls are found on the last page of each form.
On application to the Adjutant General of the Army, a
list of <em>model remarks</em> for the rolls will be furnished.</p>

<p>The principal <em>Returns</em> with which the novice should become
familiar are the <em>Ration</em>, <em>Clothing</em>, <em>Ordnance</em>, <em>Company</em>
(monthly), and <em>Field</em> Returns.</p>

<p><em>Estimates</em> and <em>Requisitions</em> are used most frequently
by the Supply Departments. But organizations must prepare
<em>Estimates</em> of what they will need, and must prepare
<em>Requisitions</em> for the desired articles when needed. The
<em>Clothing Estimate</em> and <em>Clothing Requisition</em> are two common
and important forms.</p>

<p>Among the <em>Routine Reports</em> in the military service
should be mentioned the <em>Morning</em>, <em>Inventory</em> and <em>Inspection</em>,
<em>Sick</em>, and certain <em>Reports</em> in official letter form.</p>

<p>The form of <em>Routine Report</em> which is most common is
the <em>Morning Report</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>


<h3>EXPLANATIONS</h3>

<p>As we took up in each case after written work pertaining
to combat the similar verbal task, so now after we have
discussed written correspondence we are going to dwell
upon the ordinary verbal labor incumbent upon officers and
non-commissioned officers in the military service.</p>

<p>In war or peace a military leader is useless without an
effective tongue. We have demonstrated his uselessness in
combat; we shall see that he is just as unsatisfactory in
training men for combat.</p>

<p>The work of any military individual in command of men
is not only that of <em>doing</em> but also that of telling others
<em>how</em> to do. The <em>Explanation</em> of the efficient leader is a
continuous process from morning until night. He is constantly
called upon to make his words count. If he halts,
he loses time. If he hesitates, he makes his men restless.
He must speak straight through to the end in a clear-cut
way, never hedging or repeating; and when he has finished,
the listeners should feel that the subject has been completely
covered.</p>

<p>If he does not form the habit of so talking, he forfeits
his power of leadership. For what good is an intelligent
or inventive officer, if he cannot put his intelligence or invention
out through his lips? The military profession is
one which depends upon quick instruction by word of
mouth. The officer who does his own work and the work
of his sergeants too, is plainly inefficient. He has avoided
the harder task—that of teaching others how to carry on
the work. He has done worse. He has lessened the value
of his organization as an automatic machine. When he
leaves it, it will either fall to pieces or place a weighty
burden on the officer relieving him.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>There is one caution which a military man should observe
in his speech on the drill ground, in barracks, or in
the field. He should not repeat unnecessarily. He should
not allow his men to gain the idea that if they do not listen
at once he will tell them later. It should be an understood
fact that his <em>Explanation</em>, once stated, stands. Of course
he may reiterate during his talk for the sake of emphasis.
But he should by practice be so capable of telling everything
so unmistakably the first time over that no reasonable
question can be asked.</p>

<p>Good explanations make for attention on the part of
his men, and attention makes for an increase of good work.
Sooner or later the achievements of his organization contrast
it favorably with other organizations and his brother
officers say, “He has made a success.” Much of that success
has come to him because he has set for himself, and
followed these simple rules:</p>

<p>(1) “I will try today not to say anything which is
not exactly expressive of what I mean.”</p>

<p>(2) “I will try whenever I write to make myself unmistakable.”</p>

<p>(3) “I will try whenever I speak to make every word
distinct from every other word.”</p>

<p>(4) “I will try whenever I read to see how others express
themselves so that I may at the next opportunity
imitate that part of their style which says most in the
simplest way.”</p>

<p>(5) “I will make every good new word my own, because
the vocabulary of my present life is limited.”</p>

<p>(6) “I will do all this because by so doing I shall
develop myself in my profession, and because I may some
day fail that profession if I neglect that development now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>


<h3>LECTURES</h3>

<p><em>Lectures</em> are but extended <em>Explanations</em>. Officers are
more and more being called upon to appear before large
audiences of educated people in order to give to the country
military knowledge. Training Camps and war are increasing
the necessity for the delivery of lectures.</p>

<p>Because the <em>Lecture</em> takes more time, it should be more
carefully developed than the <em>Explanation</em>. The subject
should be divided into its various parts in a logical way.
It should be bound together coherently. And each part
should have in it only what belongs there. This process
is simply that of following the rules of English with which
we are already acquainted. The purpose is speed and
clearness.</p>

<p>There are other elements which enter into the betterment
of a long talk. Since an audience is human, there is
reason in helping it through a dry subject. The treatment
of the <em>Lecture</em> may in this way, besides aiding the interest,
make the points stick longer. Two qualities which help to
attain this treatment are <em>Humor</em> and <em>Presence</em>.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the American does not need to be told to
cultivate humor. He reeks with it. But there are some instructors
whose minds work along so impassively that it is
difficult for them to be wakened from their gravity. To
them the conscious development of the short anecdote,
homely illustration, and incongruous phrase is a splendid
aid. The great majority, however, must be guarded in the
use of humor. The quality itself may be overworked so
that the proportion of matter in the Lecture is small in
comparison to the witticisms. Humor is but a means to an
end. Its sole object should be to lighten the talk in order
to help the subject into the auditor’s mind more easily.
Fun should be incidental and made without effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>As to <em>Presence</em> more can be said in its favor. It is an
indispensable quality in a speaker. If his diaphragm is
in his mouth during his delivery, or if his heart action is
violent, the audience cannot be fooled. It will be made
uncomfortable. A speaker should have such ordinary
fluency of accurate expression through practice that he
entertains no fears of obscure or halting language. He
should be so familiar with the sensations of looking into
a number of faces that he will feel at ease. He should impress
his audience that he enjoys standing before them for
the purpose of imparting interesting knowledge. Such
<em>Presence</em> can be attained only by taking advantage of
every opportunity for correct public and private speech.
The military novice should enter every impersonal discussion
he can find, and should urge himself to speak whenever
possible to more than a dozen people at a time.</p>

<p>He must be more than an ordinary talker, for he must
have speed and interest as ready agents of his ideas. To
gain those qualities is a matter of constant attention to
speaking and to writing exactly what he wishes to say.</p>

<p>We have now covered the territory of military communications.
We have seen the necessity for correct expression,
and the difficulty of its attainment. What we have
done should be but a beginning. It may be a long struggle
to gain brevity and clarity—the terse and the unmistakable.
But achievement will come with practice and will
repay us fully in future satisfaction, and increased worth
in our profession.</p>
